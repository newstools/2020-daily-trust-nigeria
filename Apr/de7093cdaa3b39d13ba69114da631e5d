Some residents of Abuja suburbs have said they took to various exercises and sporting activities to ease the burden of the lockdown and also keep their bodies fit. During evening hours, youths take to their various football pitches around Karu, Nyanya and Jikwoyi while others engage in indoor sports such as badminton and table tennis to ease the boredom of the lockdown imposed to curtail the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Akpan Joshua who was out on a walk with his family said, “I was advised by my doctor to do some exercise under this lockdown and I decided to take my family along. We are doing this to avoid the health implication of staying in one place for a long time”. City News reporter who went round the sporting venues found that participants and spectators did not observe social distancing. Some players and the spectators who spoke to City News said the stay-at-home order led to boredom which has forced them to engage in different activities to keep themselves busy. One of the youths at Karu Site, Bolaji Akinfenwa said ‘We have stayed at home longer than we used to do. Most of us got tired and decided to come out and play some games. We want to ease the boredom by playing football with our mates”. Abdullahi Kamilu, a spectator, said they are not worried about the pandemic “because it has not reached the suburbs”. A resident of Nyanya, Vivian Simon said “As you can see, I am using this morning hour to walk and run so that I can keep under this lockdown.
