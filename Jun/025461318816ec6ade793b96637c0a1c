The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has said he is not nursing the ambition of running for the office of the President of Nigeria. Gov. Wike stated this while featuring in a television programme monitored in Port Harcourt. He said the speculations linking him to presidential ambition were distractions. He further said, “Right now, I am focusing on delivering the dividends of democracy to the people of Rivers State. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. “Recall that in 2018 and 2019 when I was supporting my friend, Aminu Waziri Tambulwal, it was speculated in the media that I was going to run with him. That was my first tenure, and I had not even completed it and they wanted me to give that away. “To clear every speculation, let me state that I am not going to run for the office of the President of Nigeria for now. I am concentrating in developing Rivers State. I am not a party to anybody saying that the problems in PDP is about 2023.” Commenting on a former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar’s aspiration to contest for the presidency 2023, Wike said it was a fundamental right that could not be denied. On zoning of PDP presidential ticket to the North, Gov. Wike said the National Executive Council (NEC) of the party had not taken a final decision. He explained that, “We will come together to resolve issues because we are a family. Outsiders cannot do things that will divide us. What we are interested in now is how we can remain united to take over power from APC that has failed Nigeria.”  2023: I have no Presidential ambition - Wike Wike is afraid of Wike 2015: Wike’s Rivers’ guber ambition tears PDP apart
