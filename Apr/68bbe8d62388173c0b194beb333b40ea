The Nigeria Humanitarian Action (NIHA), in partnership with Tradomed Pharmaceuticals, has donated 1,200 packs of malaria drugs to Dutsen Makaranta Primary Health Care Centre in Bwari Area Council, FCT. Speaking at the handover of the drugs at the centre, the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director of Tradomed Pharmaceuticals, Charles Iheanacho, said the drugs would support the healthcare centre and they would be given to people free of charge. He added that the drugs were to help in the fight against malaria in the community. “Malaria is the biggest pandemic we have in Africa, Nigeria mostly, when COVID-19 hits, it’s going to be worse,” he said. Charles added that “if we are able to prevent malaria attacks in our society, it means that we have won the war against COVID-19 by more than 90 per cent.” A staff of the PHC, Dr Okafor Lucky, who spoke on behalf of the management expressed delight over the donations they received. Lucky said for the past one month some people in the community have tested positive for malaria but did not have money to pay for drugs, adding that they would benefit from the donation. He said, “This support will go a long way to help the people as now they can come and get their medication for free’’.
