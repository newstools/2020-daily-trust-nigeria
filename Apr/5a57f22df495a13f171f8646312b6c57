The Nigeria Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has sensitised some of the rural communities in Abuja on the Coronavirus pandemic that is bedeviling the country and the world at large. The Comptroller General, NSCDC, Abdullahi Muhammadu Gana, at the sensitisation programme said that the Corps deemed it fit to voluntarily contribute to the fight against the COVID-19. The three communities visited in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja were Nwalege, Gui and Sauka. Gana said that the Corps had been active in enforcing lockdown a part of effort to curtail the spread of the COVID-19, saying that the Corps had deployed about 9500 staff across the country, adding that about 500 were deployed in Abuja alone. He noted that there were areas in the country that were not aware of the virus affecting the world, adding however, that the Corps had been going round to sensitise the affected areas. “We have gone round ensuring that these people knows and are familiar with the COVID-19 in the Nigeria. “And the surprise I got lately was that the Management staff has started contributions volunterily to buy foodstuff and distributes as there had been lockdown in the FCT, “he said. Gana appreciated the general public on the level of compliance as regard the lockdown in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun, saying that it had been a tremendous achievement since the lockdown. Earlier, Mrs Lucy Fakoya, an NSCDC officer while addressing the Nwalege community, Abuja said that there was need for the community to know the dangers attached to not keeping good hygiene. Fakoya noted that keeping social distancing, washing of hands and applying sanitisers were the major ways of protecting oneself against the virus.
