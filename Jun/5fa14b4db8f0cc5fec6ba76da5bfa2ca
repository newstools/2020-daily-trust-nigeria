Elected local government council chairmen in Zamfara State who were relieved of their positions by Governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle have vowed to challenge their removal in court. Recall that Gov. Matawalle recently dissolved all the 14 local government councils but later reappointed eight chairmen. The eight local council chairmen who have been reappointed had earlier defected from the opposition APC to the ruling PDP; while the six who stayed put in APC and refused to cross carpet to the PDP were sacked. Those sacked were the chairmen of Gusau, Mafara, Bakura, Maradun, Gumi and Shinkafi LGAs. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. One of the affected chairmen, Alhaji Babangida Abdullahi, who disclosed their intention to seek redress in court, told newsmen in Abuja that their removal from office was illegal and unconstitutional. Abdullahi, who was the Chairman of Gusau, lamented that the resolution of the House of Assembly which the governor relied on to remove them from office was most undemocratic and autocratic.
