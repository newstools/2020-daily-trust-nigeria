The All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are bickering over the recruitment of INEC ad hoc staff for the October 31 by-election for Plateau South senatorial district. PDP through its Plateau State Publicity Secretary, John Akans, had accused APC of conniving with the electoral umpire in the state to recruit its supporters to manipulate the by-election in its favour. But the state Secretary of the APC, Alhaji Bashir Musan Sati, faulted the allegations, saying the accusation was baseless, describing it as “PDP’s chains of lies.” “Should the factionalized PDP, in its bewildering status forget, we soberly remind it that INEC is the only lawful statutory agency of government that is saddled with the onerous responsibility of recruiting ad hoc staff,” he said.
