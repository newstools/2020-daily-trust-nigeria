The police in Lagos said they have arrested a suspected secret cult leader, Bamidele Moses, alias Badoo, who they alleged had been terrorising residents of the Bariga area and its environs. The arrest of Moses, who was said to have been on the police wanted list for many months allegedly for multiple murders and robbery, followed the earlier arrest of one of his gang members, Sodiq Olowolayemo, 23, with whom he had allegedly conspired to rob a man, Jude Saka, of his Bajaj motorcycle on December 8, 2019. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said that on November 1, 2019, following information received about the activities of some suspected cultists in the Bariga area, the police began investigation on the movement of the gang. Elkana added that the police received another piece of information last Friday that the gang was planning to launch an attack in Ilaje, Bariga. The police spokesman said that based on the strength of the information, detectives from the Bariga police station moved to Ilaje, Bariga, where they arrested Sodiq, a resident of No. 10, Onenaya Street, Bariga. The suspect was said to have confessed that he conspired with Moses to rob Saka of his Bajaj motorcycle. “The suspects have been on the police wanted list for series of traffic robberies and cult violent attacks in Bariga,” Elkana said.
