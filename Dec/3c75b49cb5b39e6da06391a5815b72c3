The Edo State chairman of the PDP, Tony Azegbeimi, yesterday denied knowledge of any plan to dissolve the state party executive by Governor Godwin Obaseki. Azeigbemi made the clarification while reacting to the allegation that Governor Obaseki had ordered the dissolution of the state party executive in order to install his loyalists. He said the party was governed by its constitution, adding that the priority now was to support the governor to succeed in the development of the state. On complaints over the appointment of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) without party input, he said those appointed so far were personal aides of the governor. The PDP chairman said the governor would consult widely while constituting his cabinet.
