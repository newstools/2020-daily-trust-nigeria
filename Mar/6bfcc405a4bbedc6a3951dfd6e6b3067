President Muhammadu Buhari says Nigeria’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Justice George Adesola Oguntade, earned his respect for upholding the truth with the decision to nullify the victory of the Late President Umaru Musa Yar’adua. Buhari, in a tribute to Justice Oguntade as contained in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, joined the Nigerian Body of Benchers and the Nigerian Bar Association in celebrating former Justice of the Supreme Court on his 80th birthday. He said the former Chancellor, University of Lagos and High Commissioner earned his respect while serving at the Supreme Court, before his retirement in 2010, by the way he conducted himself with “virtue, honesty and conviction to do the right thing.’’ In his letter to the legal luminary, Buhari said: “To be an outstanding jurist, you must be ready to be different, even if it means standing alone. I will never forget my legal challenge of the presidential election of 2007. It was such a disorderly, chaotic and badly manipulated poll, that the man declared winner, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, himself admitted the process was highly flawed. “However, the Supreme Court, in its judgement, upheld the election, except for a minority position maintained by three justices, led by Justice Oguntade. He nullified the poll for not complying with the Electoral Act. It was a split of four against three. You don’t have too many like this great jurist anymore. “He was not afraid to stand alone, when it came to upholding the truth. For that display of virtue, honesty and conviction to do the right thing, Justice Oguntade earned my respect.” FG writes British Parliamentary group, denies persecution of Christians Ribadu, Oguntade hail judiciary, seek quick judgment delivery London Trip: Buhari returns to Abuja 2 days ahead of schedule
