Security operatives on Wednesday evening arrived the National Secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja to enforce the judgement of an FCT High Court which suspended the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. The Police officers who arrived the party’s secretariat at about 5:10pm in about nine trucks quickly surrounded the Blantyre office of the party and ordered individuals who are not members of staff to vacate the premises.
