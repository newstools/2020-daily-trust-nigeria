Thirteen PDP aspirants in the forthcoming March 28 local government council election in Cross River State have said that their party risks losing the state to the opposition party, APC. In a petition they jointly signed and submitted to the national headquarters of the party against its leadership in the state, they accused the state executives of imposition. The petition was signed by all 13 candidates, among them Godwin Offiono (Yala), Naku John (Ogoja LGA), Ikpi Ubana Eyong (Yakurr LGA) Obi Stephen Owan (Etung LGA) and Orok Bassey Duke (Odukpani LGA). They said, “We therefore respectfully urge you to admonish the leadership of the party in Cross River State, to cancel the entire process, which was a sham, and conduct fresh primary elections for the emergence of candidates”. Reacting, state chairman of the party, Ntufam Edim Inok, said nobody has the right to complain because they were not doing anything out of the ordinary, adding that those complaining were not their members.” Protesters sack PDP national secretariat, officials 9 states with most dramatic governorship primaries Will Wike, Emmanuel get reprieve at Supreme Court?
