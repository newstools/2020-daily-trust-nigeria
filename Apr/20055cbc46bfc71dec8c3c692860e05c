The Lagos State Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, on Tuesday ordered the suspension of all court activities in the five judicial divisions of the state’s judiciary. Alogba issued the order following the lockdown announced by President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State to combat the coronavirus pandemic in the state. The CJ’s order was contained in a circular titled, ‘Entry Into Court Premises Guidelines No. 2’ dated March 30, 2020 and signed on his behalf by the Chief Registrar, Mrs Taiwo Olatokun. It notified members of the public of the suspension of all court activities effective Tuesday March 31, until further notice. The Chief Judge directed Administrative Magistrates in the seven Magistrative Districts to sit only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays between the hours of 10am and 1pm, and take only remand and bail applications on offences such as terrorism, armed robbery, homicide and other non-bailable offences. The seven Magisterial Districts are Ikeja, Lagos, Yaba, Ikorodu, Apapa, Badagry and Epe. The order also directed the Assistant Chief Registrars (Administrative) in each of the districts to serve as Registrars for such sittings of the magistrate courts.
