The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, said that the Federal Government had trained 450,000 Nigerians on plumbing, pipefitting and other skills for self-employment in the last three and half years. Mustapaha disclosed this during the graduation ceremony and the distribution of start-up packs to beneficiaries of the 2019 National Industrial Skills Development Programme (NISDP) held in Abuja. The SGF, who was represented by Permanent Secretary in charge of Political and Economic Affairs, David Adejo, said the government, through the various skills acquisition trainings of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), is tackling unemployment and poverty. According to him, the government has provided avenues to increase access to credits through the N250 billion Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Fund, the Growth Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) and developing alternative collateral programmes for small businesses. In his remarks, the Director General of the ITF, Sir Joseph Ari, said since its inception, the NISDP had equipped over 200,000 Nigerians nationwide and 18,000 from the FCT with skills for employability and entrepreneurship. Ari said the training for the beneficiaries  who graduated lasted between three and six months, depending on the trade and in all, over 11,000 Nigerians were equipped with skills in nine trades. “We believe that given the intensity and the very practical nature of the training, which was 80 percent practical and 20 percent theory, they were equipped with the necessary skills and attitudes for them to thrive as employees or as entrepreneurs,” the DG added. “When tied with the trades, which were chosen after careful and in-depth need analysis of their locales, we have no doubt they will thrive, as trades they have learned will always be needed,” the DG added. He listed some of the vocations the beneficiaries were trained on as including Leather Works (Shoe and Bag Making), Welding and Fabrication, Catering and Event Management, Tiling, Production and Laying of Interlock Tiles, Furniture Making, Domestic Electrical Wiring and Installation, Solar Energy Installation, Plumbing and Pipefitting, and Autogelle and Beauty Care.
