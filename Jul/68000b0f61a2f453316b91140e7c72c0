The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) has partnered the Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) to attract domestic and foreign investors to the nation’s 41 Free Trade Zones (FTZs). Confirming the collaboration when he visited NIPC’s Executive Secretary, Yewande Sadiku, in Abuja on Wednesday, the Managing Director of NEPZA, Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, said the partnership was the antidote to hindrances to the smooth operations of the FTZs. He said: “NEPZA is supposed to be on top of its game in terms of promoting investment. The strategies to industrialise the country as it is with other countries must be people-friendly. “You have to know your stakeholders very closely to meet their needs and make them happy. This is the core mandate of both NEPZA and NIPC.” Sadiku expressed support for NEPZA’s approaches to attract and maintain investors, adding that the agency has a great platform to drive the country’s industrialization agenda for results. “The commission is ready to support NEPZA to succeed. Such a partnership is needed even among all agencies of government as no man is an island,” she said.
