The federal government has flagged off the National Home-grown School Feeding Programme at Kuje Primary School in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, while flagging-off the programme said it is funded by the federal government but implemented by the states and the FCT. “The commencement of the school feeding programme today is based on Mr. President’s directive to the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development to liaise with state governments to develop strategies on the continuation of the school feeding programme,” she said. Farouq added that the home feeding programme is a globally accepted means of supporting children to continue to have access to nutrient rich foods despite disruptions to the traditional channels of school feeding.
