Political appointees from rural development areas (RDAs) of Bayelsa State yesterday barricaded the entrance to the state Government House over their unpaid two months salaries. Speaking with newsmen in Yenagoa, the political appointees said that they were on a peaceful protest to demand for their December 2019 and January 2020 salaries. The protesters carried placards with different inscription, such as “Dickson, pay our two months salaries”, We are workers and not slaves” and Give us our right,” among others. Mr Wilson Oruwori, the RDA Chairman of Kaiko-Ibeawa in Odioma Community, Brass Local Government area, explained that their appointment took effect from Oct. 15, 2019, when the state was preparing for the governorship election. (NAN) “Our appointment was supposed to be from Oct. 15, 2019 to February 2020; but now, the governor is making a pronouncement that he had terminated our appointment since Dec. 16, 2019. “Everyone knows that we are entitled to our December and January salary because we are still in service as stated in our appointment letters and our identity card will expire in February. “So, we are here today on a peaceful demonstration to demand for the immediate payment of our two months salaries, that is, December and January,” he said. As at the time of filling this report, no government official had, however, come out to address the protesting political appointees. 2019 Polls: States in desperate moves to clear salary backlog Impeachment: How Ortom, Akume rift traps loyalists Kwara’s cost cutting measures take toll on political appointments
