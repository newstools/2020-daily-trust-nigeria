The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has disclosed plans to develop Jabi Lake in Abuja and other inland waterways to generate revenue and boost the economy. This was disclosed by the Managing Director of the Authority, Dr. George Muoghalu, during an official visit to Jabi Lake and facilities around it. “Apart from the revenues that we can generate from Jabi Lake, we can also have a resort, a centre where people can go for relaxation. There is quite a lot we want to do with this place,” the NIWA boss said. Dr. Muoghalu said Jabi Lake has potentials to attract tourists if developed with necessary facilities, secured and kept clean. He said Nigeria has about 10, 000 kilometres of waterways, out of which about 3000 kilometres are navigable and should be developed. The NIWA boss inspected commercial and residential houses erected on NIWA’s lands around Jabi Lake and called on the owners of such property to approach NIWA to pay the necessary fees to regularise their occupation of the lands.
