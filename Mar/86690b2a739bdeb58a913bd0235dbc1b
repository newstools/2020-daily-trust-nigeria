The Chairman, Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, Augustine Akubeze, has urged leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Edo State chapter to study the Holy Quran to enable them understand the content and upgrade their knowledge. Akubeze, who is the Catholic Bishop of Benin Metropolitan Diocese, gave the charge yesterday in Benin during inauguration of new executive of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Edo State branch. Represented by Rev. Fr. David Ogun, the Parish Priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church, Benin, he noted that the church respects the tradition and culture of the land, but it is against fetish practices, hence, the need for Christians to seek knowledge on virtually everything. “By the way, some of us who are Christians should also go and study Islam to know what they know; no knowledge is wasted,” he said. He also counseled clergymen who are in the habit of blackmailing and destroying homes with their messages to desist from such practice. Also speaking, South-South zone Chairman of CAN, Archbishop Ege Israel, noted that the unity of the Church is not negotiable as it reflects the glory of God in the lives of Christians.
