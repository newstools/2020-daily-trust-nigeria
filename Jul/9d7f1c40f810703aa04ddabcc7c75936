An FCT High Court on Wednesday ordered that a 46-year-old man, Oman Suleiman, who sexually abused his two daughters, to be remanded in the custody of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). NAPTIP charged Suleiman with three counts bordering on sexual abuse. Justice Peter Kekemeke also ordered the defendant’s counsel to put the prosecution on notice and adjourned the case to July 13, 2020, for the hearing of the defendant’s application for bail. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Mr A.O. Shaibu, told the court that the defendant who lived with his family in Karu, FCT, committed the offence between June, 2018 and February, 2020. Shuaibu said, between the dates, the defendant allegedly abused his 16-year-old and 14-year-old daughters and inflicted injuries on them. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 1 (2) of the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015. Counsel to the defendant, Mr. Labio Oji, applied orally for his bail citing Sections 158 and 162 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015. Objecting, Shaibu told the court that a matter as serious as that should not be taken lightly by oral bail application. (NAN)
