Gov Ben Ayade of Cross River State has obtained approval from the state House of Assembly to deduct N50 million from each of the 18 LGAs’ funds in the state to intensify campaign against the spread the coronavirus pandemic now ravaging the world. The governor announced that the government would release the sum of N500 million to support the COVID-19 fight. He said the state has so far enjoyed financial and material donations from corporate firms, individuals and religious organisations. During its plenary session, the assembly had given the nod as its corporate support to boost the government’s prosecution of the COVID-19 fight. But reacting sharply, the leading opposition party in the state, the All Progressives Congress (APC) faulted the approval. In its statement signed by Mr Bassey Ita, state publicity secretary of the party, APC said: “It is ridiculous that with whooping provisions in the previous and recent budgets for healthcare in the state, the government is still going cap in hand to councils for funds to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic,” the statement read.
