The House of Representatives has called for the supply of free electricity to Nigerians for two months as part of measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila made the call at a meeting on Saturday between the National Assembly leadership and the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmad, the Director-General of the Budget Office of the Federation, Ben Akabueze, among others. The Speaker who was quoted in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi said the House will also propose a second Stimulus Bill to help in boosting the economy through the informal sector as the country prepares for the aftermath of the coronavirus.  He said the proposed Second Stimulus Bill will be considered immediately the House reconvenes from its ongoing break, declared due to the pandemic. It was also agreed by the leadership of the National Assembly at the meeting, that the resumption date, initially slated for April 7, will be extended by one week in compliance with government’s 2-week stay-at-home policy. Gbajabiamila said the country could not afford to be unprepared for the effect of Covid-19 on its economy, hence the necessity for the proposed stimulus bill. The Speaker said electricity, being a commodity consumed by every household, has a greater effect on the people and that since more Nigerians are in the informal sector, the effects would be more felt by the economy. “The issue of electricity, you’ll agree, because the Minister did say that she has been inundated by the public, just as we are, on several suggestions and ideas and I am almost a hundred percent sure that, from those ideas will be the issue of some kind of shelter, as far as electricity is concerned,” he said.
