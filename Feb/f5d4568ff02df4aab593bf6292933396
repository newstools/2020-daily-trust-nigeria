The Chairman of Kuje Area Council, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, has said that the council was aware of activities of revenue racketeers in the council. The chairman said such unscrupulous people were antagonists of the progress and development of the council. Sabo, who stated this while inaugurating revenue generation committee at the council conference hall yesterday, said the council would in no distance time forward a draft to the legislative arm for deliberation and amendment of some bye -law especially as that affects revenue generation in the council. “With enormous expectations on us, we are leaving no stone unturned in making sure we generate revenue so that we can actualise our goal of good governance for the people of Kuje area council,” he said. According to him, depending on the federal government monthly allocation would not take the council anywhere, hence, it was imperative for the council to devise ways of generating revenue. He therefore charged the committee members to see their nomination as a recognition of their role as critical stakeholders to the success of his administration. Responding on behalf of the 11-member committee, the chairman, Hassan Akhuzagye, thanked the chairman for the confidence he reposed in them, assuring that the committee would sit down and do a thorough job by identifying where the challenges lie and address them. The committee’s terms of reference included, identifying all areas of challenges, identifying challenges and constraints affecting revenue generation, to come up with modalities on how to checkmate and stop diversion of money, among others.
