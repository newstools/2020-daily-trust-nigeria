So the man now decided to go and fix the fuse back when he was suddenly electrocuted,”he said. He added “God has said that is the way he  will die because anytime the light trips off, he is the one that will go and fix  back the fuse on the transformer, “he added. City news learnt that the deceased, who was popularly called, Yakubu Nepa, was from a royal family in the community. Yakubu has been buried.
