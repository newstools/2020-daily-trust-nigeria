A former Senate President, David Mark, has asked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to provide a defined roadmap for political and socio-economic development of the country. Senator Mark, in a new year message made available to journalists yesterday in Abuja by his Special Adviser on Media, Paul Mumeh, also tasked government at all levels to make deliberate efforts towards addressing the issues of unemployment and insecurity in the country for Nigeria to work again. “The security situation in the country has become embarrassing and scandalous. Citizens deserve to be protected and live in peace in any part of the country without fear of molestation or intimidation,” he said. Mark, who acknowledged the resilience and perseverance of Nigerians over the years, urged them not to be deterred by the prevailing situation. He urged Nigerians to have a renewed hope and renew commitment to collective prosperity and development by contributing to nation building. “We are all one under one God. We should be our brothers’ keeper at all times,” he added.
