Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State yesterday accused his predecessor and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, of acting with impunity by not informing the state government of his visit to the state. Hosting former President Goodluck Jonathan who paid him a private visit in Benin, the Edo State capital, Obaseki insisted that Oshiomhole should have informed the state government of his visit to the state as courtesy demands. “The former president is just extending the courtesy. As the president, someone who has served the country in the highest level you heard what he said. “There is a courtesy when you are going to visit a state, you want to inform the person in charge of the state that you are coming and when you have time during the visit, you can now pay him a courtesy call. Unlike the unfortunate incident we have been having in Edo State. “It is really sad where somebody who had been the governor of a state visiting the state and does not realise that courtesy demands that he should inform the governor of his visit,” he said. In a chat with newsmen, former President Jonathan commended Governor Obaseki for “making Edo people very happy.” Contacted Oshiomhole’s spokesman, Simon Ebegbulem, only said he has been instructed not to respond to Obaseki’s comment. Oshiomole, who was in Benin on Saturday to attend the burial ceremony of late Cecilia Agbonyinma, mother of Hon Ehiozuwa Agbonyinma, was booed at the Benin Airport by hoodlums.
