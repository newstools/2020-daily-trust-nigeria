The Alumni Association of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (AANI) is currently meeting with the leadership and other stakeholders on the nation’s security challenges. The AANI National President and former Inspector-General of Police (IGP), M.D Abubakar, said this yesterday in a memo presented at the 40th Annual General Meeting of the Association held at the Shehu Musa Yar’adua Centre, Abuja. Abubakar said apart from the ongoing engagements, the alumni had focused its attention to social issues and problems like out of school children, almajiri education, banditry, rampant kidnapping and other crimes over the years. The issues which the ex-IGP put forward for consideration at yesterday’s meeting included an amendment to the constitution, an annual policy conference to underscore the theme,  recommendation of awards and privileges for Senior Executive Course (SEC) 1 and subsequent SECs, and an induction night in Abuja on the graduation of course participants as part of AANI annual calendar among others. Earlier yesterday after the completion of the 2020 Unity Walk by members of the association in Abuja, the AANI National president called for unity among Nigerians. The Corp Marshal and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Boboye Oyeyemi, himself an alumnus of NIPSS, said “We are setting aside our ethnic and religious differences to walk for Nigeria.” Comrade Isa Aremu, a former vice president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), who is also a member of the association, charged Nigerians to take ownership of the Nigerian project.
