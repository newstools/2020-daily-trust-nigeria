The Lagos State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Hyginus Omeje said road carnage on the highway would have been virtually nonexistent if the country has an efficient rail system. He said over 90 per cent of freight movement is done through the highways, noting railway is the right mode of transportation for massive movement of goods. Omeje spoke in Lagos during the award ceremony organized by the Transport Correspondents Association of Nigeria (TCAN) at the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) headquarters. According to the FRSC boss, harmonizing other modes of transportation would transcend into creating a safe motoring environment. This, he added, would also make the job of the FRSC easier, stressing that there is the need for other modes of transportation like railway and water transportation to be “up and running.” Omeje however expressed delight with the ongoing construction of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway, saying he can’t wait to see the project completed and being put to use.
