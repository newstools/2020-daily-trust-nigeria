UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson have announced that the government will allocate one billion pounds ($1.2 billion) to provide tutoring and additional resources to school students that have missed lessons as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. “This £1 billion catch-up package will help headteachers to provide extra support to children, who have fallen behind while out of school,” Johnson said as the proposals were unveiled on Friday. According to the government, $434 million will be given to support a tutoring scheme for the most disadvantaged students, and $806 million will be divided among the country’s state-run schools to bolster resources. “I am determined to do everything I can to get all children back in school from September, and we will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible,” Johnson added.
