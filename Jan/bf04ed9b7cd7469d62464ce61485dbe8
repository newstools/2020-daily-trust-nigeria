Ogboji community in Orumba South local government area of Anambra state has protested the imposition of leaders at the newly constructed market in the area. The market was built by the community through the N20 million project initiative of the governor Obiano administration. The people of the area who protested at the government house, Awka on Monday, lodged an allegation of imposition of a new leadership for the market by the immediate-past President General. Speaking on behalf of the community, Neville Uchendu said the area had enjoyed peaceful coexistence, but however regretted the current crisis which emanated from bad leadership. He said that a 9-man caretaker committee of reputable persons of the community had been set up to find a lasting solution to the crises and restore peace to the area. He appealed to the governor to approve the committee for inauguration in view of the high profile and pedigree of its members. “Ogboji has been known for peace. But there have been crises in the past six years due to bad leadership. But we have resolved to put an end to it and restore peace to the community. “The problem emanated when the outgone President General started selling over 90 shops in the market. “The lock-up and open shops were sold for N200,000 and N50,000 respectively to non-indigenes of the community. “When the women cried out, I reminded them of government’s promise that the market built to alleviate their sufferings would not be sold. At worst, it would be leased out to the indigenes.” he stated.
