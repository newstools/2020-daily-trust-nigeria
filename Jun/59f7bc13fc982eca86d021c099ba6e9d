Operatives of the Lagos State Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on Saturday arrested a suspected traffic robber, Mayowa Adedoyin, 19. The police alleged that they intercepted Adedoyin and a colleague of his on Oshodi-Oke, Lagos, robbing a middle-aged man. While the RRS operatives were able to arrest Adedoyin, his colleague-in-crime escaped through the inner streets of Oshodi. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the arrest, said, “Our riders, acting on a report, laid siege to the duo and Adedoyin was arrested at about 9pm robbing in traffic. He has been handed over to the Makinde police station in Oshodi. Our riders are on the look-out for his colleague.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
