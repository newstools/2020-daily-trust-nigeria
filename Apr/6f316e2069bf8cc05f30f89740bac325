 A meeting yesterday by top federal government’s top officials, principal officers of the House of Representatives and stakeholders in the power sector resolved to set up a joint committee to work out modalities for the proposed two-month free power supply to Nigerians aimed at cushioning the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, according to a statement by his spokesman, Lanre Lasisi, said the committee would identify Nigerians that would benefit from the free power supply using the number of households connected to the national grid “which will give a way forward for regular power supply to Nigerians after the COVID-19 crisis.” “The objective is very simple: we’re asking people to stay at home for several days or weeks. So, we need to make their stay at home comfortable. We need to help the poorest of the poorest at this time in Nigeria,” Gbajabiamila said. The Minister of Power, Saleh Mamman, said the executive would give support and “technical advice towards the realization of this objective. We are ready whenever our input is needed.” Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mele Kyari, said the proposal “is workable if the issue of who is to carry the burden of cost and margins in the supply value chain is settled and agreed on by all the parties.” Also present at the meeting were the chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission , James Momoh; Managing Director, Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Plc, Marilyn Amobi; representatives of distribution companies; the Leader of the House, Alhassan Ado Doguwa; House Chief Whip, Mohammed Monguno; House Deputy Leader, Peter Akpatason; House Deputy Chief Whip, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; House Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu; Chairman, House Committee on Power, Magaji Da’u Aliyu; among others.
