The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has restricted the number of worshipers at churches and mosques to a maximum of 50 persons as part of measures to halt the spread of coronavirus. The coronavirus pandemic has affected at least 12 people in Nigeria since it broke out in mainland Chinese province of Wuhan late last year. The first death from the virus in Sub-Saharan African had alerted governments at various levels to taking far reaching measures to stem the fatal impact of the virus. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the FCT Minister on Media and Strategic Communications, Malam Sani Abubakar, implored religious leaders and worshipers to comply with laid down health protocols as stipulated by the relevant health authorities for the control of the Coronavirus disease while intensifying prayers for the safety of all Nigerians. “Congregations at places of worship are hereby restricted to a maximum of 50 persons at any given time. This measure also applies to social gatherings at event centers, football viewing centers and night clubs, amongst others,” part of the statement read. It further explained that the restriction was to make the tracking of suspected cases easier for the health authorities, stressing that the decision was based on the advice and guidance of public health authorities, the Presidential Task Force for the Control of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID 19), as well as the outcomes of the National Economic Council meeting, held on Thursday, March 19, 2020 and the FCT Administration’s meeting with religious leaders across the territory. Also, the statement urged residents not to engage in panic buying and always seek for information about the disease from the FCT Public Health Department and other agencies of government.
