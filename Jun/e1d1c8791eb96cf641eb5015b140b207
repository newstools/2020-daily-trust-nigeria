The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared that only zoning will determine the fate of former Vice President Atiku   Abubakar in the 2023 general election. Atiku  contested the 2019 presidential election on the platform of the PDP but lost to candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari. His son, Adamu Atiku who is the commissioner for Works and Energy in Adamawa State,  while presenting the score card of his ministry yesterday said, “In 2023, my father will be aspiring to the number one office in the land because he has been an astute, strategic,  master politician for almost four decades.” But while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja,  the PDP National Publicity Secretary,  Kola Ologbondiyan said, “The PDP has not come to discussion in respect of zoning. I want to leave it at that.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
