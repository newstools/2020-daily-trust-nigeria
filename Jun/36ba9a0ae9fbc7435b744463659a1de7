I’m sorry to say that,” he said. “With this kind of environment and condition, we fear the worst.” (AFP) Back to school in China as lockdowns start to ease worldwide No question, this is the most significant crisis the world has faced since WWII—UNGA president Why govt should not extend the ‘easing of the lockdown’ again
