The INEC has said that it will not comment on yesterdayâ€™s court ruling that barred the commission from delisting 31 of the 74 de-registered political parties. Mr Rotimi Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, told Daily Trust that the commission will not comment on the court ruling. However, relishing the euphoria of a Federal High Court judgement sitting in Abuja, which restrained INEC, from delisting them, the 74 political parties earlier deregistered by the INEC, have dedicated the victory to late human rights activists, Chief Gani Fawehinmi. The parties, at a press conference yesterday in Abuja, shortly after the court ruling, also vowed to give the late legal luminary a posthumous award for laying the very solid foundation which enable them to win the court case instituted against the electoral umpire for wrongful de-registration. Justice Anwuli Chikere of the Federal High Court, Abuja, restrained INEC from deregistering 31 political parties. Justice Chikere, in her ruling, said having failed to counter the application by the applicants, the affected political parties had the legal right which must be protected. Speaking at the briefing in Abuja, the National President of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), High Chief Peter Ameh, told newsmen that the judgement was victory for democracy and rule of law. He wondered why INEC was bent on halting the muiti-party democracy in the country.
