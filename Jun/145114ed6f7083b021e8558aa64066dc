Tragedy was averted at Ijero Ekiti, in Ijero Local Government Area, Ekiti State, on Tuesday when fire razed a section of the Owa Ajero’s palace but sympathisers successfully evacuated six children of the Owa Ajero, Oba Joseph Adebayo Adewole, who were trapped in the building. The king’s wife, Olori Christianah Adewole, told newsmen yesterday that on Tuesday, about 4pm, visitors to the palace suddenly observed fire surging from a section of the palace.             She said despite spirited efforts by sympathisers, the fire burnt the four-bedroom building and it took the courageous intervention of people to rescue the six children who were inside the rooms in the bungalow. “The children were evacuated through the windows,” the queen said.           The Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has assured Oba Adewole of government’s support to rebuild the damaged section of the palace.
