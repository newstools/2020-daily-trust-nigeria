A Chief Magistrate Court in Kaduna State has ruled that the application for stay of execution in the trial of the former Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, Chidi Anselm Odinkalu, instituted by the Kaduna State Government lacks merit and substance and ordered the police to continue its investigation in the matter. Daily Trust reports that Odinkalu is facing charges of inciting disturbance, injurious falsehood, public nuisance and furnishing false information instituted by the Kaduna State Government, following the alleged killing of 66 Fulani residents of Kajuru in 2019. The Magistrate court had in March 2019, transferred the case to the Police for investigation. However, the ruling of the Magistrate court came despite an order of a Kaduna High Court, which granted interim stay of proceedings, granting leave to Odinkalu to seek judicial review by way of an order for certiorari. The order, which Daily Trust verified dated January 20, 2020, made by S.S Daka stated that; “Leave is hereby granted to apply for a judicial review by way of an order for certiorari in case KMD/  /2019 between the state versus Odinkalu.” It also stated that; “An order is hereby granted stipulating that the granting of leave of paragraph 1 above shall operate in the interim to stay proceedings in suit KMD/ /2019, pending the hearing of the motion on notice.” After perusing the case file at the Chief Magistrate court, our correspondents reports that Justice Ibrahim Musa had ruled that; “leave if granted is followed with an order of the High Court to the court where interlocutory is sought against and in most cases, the order of the High Court directing the transmission of the record of proceedings, and sometimes to even staying proceedings of the affected court pending the determination of the application.” Citing S306 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and S317 of Administration of Criminal Justice Law, Kaduna State, Justice Musa stated that the sections categorically provide that an application for stay of proceedings in a criminal matter before the court shall not be entertained. “That the word used in both sections is ‘Shall’ and therefore connotes compulsion, and so the court has no discretion,” he stated.
