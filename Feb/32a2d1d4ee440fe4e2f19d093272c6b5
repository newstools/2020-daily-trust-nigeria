The Nigerian Air Force says air raids by its ongoing air interdiction campaign “Operation Rattle Snake 3 ” has destroyed an Islamic State of West Africa Province training camp at Kirta Wulgo on the fringes of the Lake Chad in the northern part of Borno State. Operation Rattle Snake 3, which commenced in December 2019, is an air interdiction mission carried out by the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole in the northeast to destroy terrorist elements. NAF spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola , in a statement yesterday, said the air strikes conducted on Sunday on the heels of credible intelligence reports as well as series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions established that some structures within the settlement were being used by the terrorists to house and train their fighters. He said the ATF dispatched an enhanced force package of attack aircraft to engage the identified locations within the settlement. Daramola said the fighter jets took turns attacking the target area in successive passes taking out the training facilities. He said the NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, would sustain its air campaign to shape the battle space in the northeast for the effective conduct of further ground and air operations.
