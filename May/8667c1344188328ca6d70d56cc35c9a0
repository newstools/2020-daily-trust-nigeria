The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday rejected claims by Tanzanian President John Magufuli that coronavirus tests in his country had been faulty. WHO Africa director Matshidiso Moeti rejected the claim at a media briefing. “We are convinced that the tests … are not contaminated with the virus. “We are not in agreement with (Magufuli’s) point of view,” Moeti said.

Dr John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC), said Tanzania was using test kits supplied by the Africa CDC in collaboration with the Chinese Jack Ma Foundation, which met international standards. “Tanzania is using the same test that everyone is using,” Nkengasong said, noting that it was improbable the tests were faulty. Meanwhile, Tanzania has suspended the director and quality control manager of its national laboratory pending an investigation after the allegedly faulty results. Tanzania’s Health Ministry made this known in a statement. Magufuli’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has received much criticism, as the East African nation has implemented only few measures to curb the spread of the virus. Social distancing is hardly practiced in Tanzania, where mosques and churches remain open. Magufuli has also suggested praying and herbal steam baths could help prevent infection. The East African nation has reported 480 coronavirus cases so far.
