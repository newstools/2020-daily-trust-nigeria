The Chairman of Karu Gbagyi Development Association (KAGBADA), Mr. Dangana Jimiko, said the naming of the Karu Town Hall after Mrs. Jummai Aduda, the late mother of the Senator representing the FCT, Philip Aduda, was a collective decision of the association and stakeholders in the chiefdom. Mr. Jimiko, who spoke with newsmen in Karu yesterday while reacting to a media report that the hall was a constituency project of Aduda, which was why it was named after his late mother, said the publication by the media on the alleged naming of a constituency project in Karu after the late Mrs. Jummai Aduda, was a deliberate move to misinform the people of the FCT and Nigerians. Jimiko said, “It is on this premise that we are informing the general public to disregard the malicious publication, as it was the collective decision of Karu community under KAGBADA to name the hall after the late mother of Sen. Aduda.” He said the late mother of Sen. Aduda was a great grassroots mobiliser, government advisor on community relations, politician, women and well-known community leader.
