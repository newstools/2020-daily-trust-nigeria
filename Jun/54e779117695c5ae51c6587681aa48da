Leaders of three commercial motorcycle riders unions in Ogun State impounded more than 100 motorcycles yesterday as part of their moves to avert the state government’s threat to ban their operations in the state. Governor Dapo Abiodun had threatened to ban the operation of commercial motorcyclists, popularly called ‘okada’, allegedly because of their flagrant disobedience to the government’s restriction order on COVID-19. The state government mandates ‘okada’ riders to carry only one passenger at a time as it battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus scourge, but the government observed that the riders had been breaking the law by carrying two passengers or more. To avert the ban, the three ‘okada’ unions that the state government recognised swiftly constituted a COVID-19 Joint Task Force to enforce the government’s directive on their members. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. The unions are the Amalgamated Commercial Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association of Nigeria (ACOMORAN), the Articulate Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association (AMORAN) and the Riders and Owners of Motorcycles Organization (ROMO). The Ogun State Chairman of ACOMORAN, Kayode Showunmi, who led the task force team in Abeokuta yesterday, disclosed that the team had impounded about 100 motorcycles for flouting the government’s order. Showunmi noted that the exercise took place simultaneously across all parts of the state, saying there was the need to avert a government’s ban of their operations. He maintained that ‘okada’ riders must comply with the single-passenger directive and always wear their face masks. He said the enforcement would be a continuous process until total compliance was achieved among commercial motorcyclists in the state.
