United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) has released unaudited financial report for the first quarter of 2020 which showed relatively positive improvements   across key financial indicators. The bank’s net interest income for the first quarter period increased by 12.6% to N65.4 billion, up from N58 billion in Q1 2019. Total non-interest income also rose from N25.6 billion in Q1 2020 to N28.5 billion during the period under review. The  net operating income after impairment loss on loans and receivables increased by 11.3% to N91.3 billion in Q1 2020, up from N81.9 billion in Q1 2019. Total Operating Expense rose by 12.9% to N58.6 billion, up from N51.9 billion in Q1 2019. What this shows, therefore, is that the bank incurred a little bit more cost in the course of its operations during the first three months of the year. The lender’s profit before tax for the Q1 period under review stood at N32.7 billion. This indicates an 8.5% increase when compared to N30.1 billion profit before tax that the company recorded in Q1 2019.
