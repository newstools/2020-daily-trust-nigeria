The Ona of Abaji and chairman of FCT council of traditional rulers, Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has called on the Federal Ministry of Health to provide testing kits across the six area councils to make testing for coronavirus easy. Alhaji Adamu, while speaking with our reporter in his palace yesterday, noted that only senior citizens and government officials are able to have access to the testing kits, which he said was not proper. “I believe if we can have test centres across the area councils of the FCT, it will help as residents will have easy access to test for the Covid-19, instead of only the big men alone,” he said. He also called on residents of the FCT to ensure they comply with the stay at home and social distance order by the government, saying such move will help to curtail the spread of the virus. The traditional ruler, however, commended the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, for his promise to provide palliatives for vulnerable people in the territory. He advised that the committee set up to oversee the distribution of relief materials to the vulnerable persons should ensure that it was done judiciously without prejudice to ethnicity, religion and politics.
