The Director of Road Traffic Services of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Wadata Aliyu Bodinga has reiterated the resolve of the directorate and its personnel to enforce traffic rules in the city. Bodinga, who stated this during an interview with City News, yesterday,  said the directorate will not be deterred by the attitudes of members of the public, especially motorcycle riders against its officials. He lamented that commercial motorcyclists and unpainted taxi operators had attacked enforcement team of the directorate and five members were injured. “In the course of our enforcement duties, five of our personnel sustained various degrees of injuries when they tried to apprehend okada riders and unpainted taxi drivers who had floated traffic rules along the Airport Road. “The Okada operators are not only determined to violate the rules but they are also becoming a security threat because they even throw stones at our personnel. This is not acceptable,” he said. He said that the directorate, alongside the Police and Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC), has commenced a synergized enforcement around the FCT to clampdown on traffic rules violators. He added that the recent incident will not in any way deter their personnel in carrying out their duty. “We are not going back and we will continue working to see that sanity is restored in the city. The reality is that Abuja is the capital city and the Airport Road is the main entrance into the city especially for people coming from the Southern part of the country and abroad. Whatever happens on the airport road is paramount to the FCT Administration. This is why we want to sustain the enforcement to ensure adequate compliance,” he added.
