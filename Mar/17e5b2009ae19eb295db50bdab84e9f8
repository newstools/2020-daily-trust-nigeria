The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has presented the Integrated Dairies Limited (IDL), producers of youghurt and fresh milk, the certificate of Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) for maintaining high quality standard in its production processes. Speaking at the certificate presentation ceremony in Jos, Plateau State, the SON State Coordinator, Musa George, urged the manufacturing company to sustain its standard and advised other entities in the nation’s industries to remain committed to standardisation of their production processes. George explained that some consumable-producing organisations which did not observe the required standards had lost value, and that SON would continue to monitor and regulate them. In his remarks, the Managing Director (MD) of IDL, Sheyin Shekari, said his organisation would continue to maintain standard in its production, and assured that his industry was a law-abiding and would maintain professionalism. Shekari said, “We are, therefore, continually aligned with key industry regulators, including the SON, to ensure we continue to establish and maintain the highest standards of quality in IDL and the dairy industry at large.” The industrialist said the company had been providing Nigerians with 70 per cent of quality milk.
