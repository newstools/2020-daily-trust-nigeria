Five siblings who were abducted by kidnappers have regained their freedom after their three weeks in captivity. Three weeks ago, kidnappers invaded a housing estate in Pegni around 11 pm and abducted five siblings: Jubril Abdullateef, 22, Sherifat Abdullateef, 20, Muyidat Abdullateef, 13, Nura Abdullateef, 18 and Nahimat Abdullateef, nine years old. A member of the family, who preferred anonymity, disclosed the release of the victims to our reporter on Sunday, though he declined to say if a ransom was paid before the victims were freed. He said the victims were released on Saturday around 6:12 pm at an undisclosed forest at the boundary of the FCT and Nasarawa State. They are currently at an undisclosed hospital for a medical check-up. The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Mariam Yusuf, did not pick calls or reply to text message sent to her at the time of filing this report.
