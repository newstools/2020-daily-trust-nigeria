Out of the 647 matriculated students, Prof. Sandabe said Agriculture has 27; Arts and Education, 129; Sciences 261; and Social and Management Sciences, 190. “It is pertinent to note that character constitutes one of the major considerations of awarding degrees,” he said, reminding the matriculants that observance of the university’s rules and regulations, abstention from drug and substances abuse, adherence to the university’s dress code and good conduct during examinations constitute the character required of every student. “The university cannot tolerate any deviation from these moral ethical values and disobedience to the constituted authorities,” the VC warned, stressing, “in other words it (the university) would have zero tolerance to bad and poor moral character.” The Visitor to the University, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, represented by his Chief of Staff, Dr. Babagana Wakil, announced that before the end of 2020 the university would have a befitting Teaching Hospital.
