The president of the Christian Association of Nigeria yesterday decried the killing, by Boko Haram insurgents, of Rev. Lawan Andimi, the CAN chairman in Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State. The terrorists, who had demanded £200m ransom, reportedly killed the cleric on Monday after rejecting the N50m offered for his release. In a statement yesterday, Director of Legal and Public Affairs, CAN, Kwamkur Vondip, said: “The Church views the unabated kidnappings, extortions and killings of Christians and innocent Nigerians as shameful to the government that each time boasts that it has conquered insurgency. It is reprehensible and saddening that each time the government comes out to claim the defeat of the insurgency, more killings of our people are committed. “In the light of the current developments and the circumstantial facts surrounding the prevailing upsurge of attacks against the church, it will be difficult for us to believe that the Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari is not colluding with the insurgents to exterminate Christians in Nigeria bearing in mind the very questionable leadership of the security sector that has been skewed towards a religion and region! “Is that lopsidedness not a cover up for the operation of the insurgency? If not, why couldn’t the well-equipped security agents of Nigeria get this man (that was) killed rescued?” Boko Haram: CAN condemns FG over Rev. Andimi’s beheading I’m distressed, depressed by killings — Buhari Herdsmen, B/Haram working together — CAN
