The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is poised to avert any outbreak of communicable diseases in the territory as the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has put in place preventive measures. The spokesman of the Abuja Markets Management Limited (AMML), Mr. Innocent Amaechi, stated this on Sunday night during the fumigation of Wuse Market. He said the company which manages over 14 markets in the territory embarked on the exercise in all its markets as part of measures to keep them clean and safeguard residents. “The goal of the FCT minister is to ensure that the territory remains Lassa fever and Coronavirus free, so this fumigation exercise is in furtherance of that onerous goal,” he said. Amaechi said just as the AMML prepares for fire and other emergencies, it also takes responsibility when public health concerns come up, hence the fumigation exercise across the markets. He stressed that it was a market-wide exercise covering drainages, toilets and the informal sector where rodents hibernate. Also speaking, the secretary of the Wuse Market Traders Association, Alhaji Abubakar Dangara, appreciated the market managers for the exercise, saying the association on its part has been sensitising members on the need to keep the market clean. He said it is only when the market environment is kept clean that the health of traders and their customers could be preserved. The Abuja Environment Protection Board (AEPB) officials carried out the fumigation exercise.
