Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila has confirmed that he celebrated his mother’s 90th birthday in Dubai but that no public fund was used. The speaker, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, disclosed this while debunking a story by an online medium that said 300 persons were sponsored with public funds to attend the event. He said the speaker and his family held the event in Dubai with some few friends to celebrate the 90th birthday anniversary of his mother, Alhaja Lateefat Olufunke Gbajabiamila. “The story carried by Sahara Reporters on Monday, March 2, 2020, alleging that the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, used public funds to take 300 guests to Dubai for his mother’s birthday is categorically false,” the statement noted. “For the records, this event was strictly for family members and a few childhood friends for which no public funds were appropriated or expended,” the statement added.
