Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers, invaded Chaza, a community in the outskirts of Suleja town and abducted a housewife and her eldest son. Two other persons, a civil servant, Abdulmumini, who works in Abuja, and a party leader in the area, were also abducted during the attack at around 1am yesterday. A source that spoke to City News yesterday said on arrival, the attackers headed to the house of the civil servant and later the politician, whom they abducted without any resistance. “They later proceeded to the house of one Comrade Bala Tijjani, a community leader, but on noticing their arrival, he jumped from his one-storey house and escaped. So they kidnapped his wife and son,” the source further explained. Some residents of the area who spoke to our reporter over the incident, said a Sharon vehicle was later sighted speeding out of the town, while sporadic gunfire was also heard. Our reporter learnt that no communication has so far been established between the kidnappers and the victims’ families. The police area commander in Suleja, ACP Sani Badarwa, confirmed the incident, adding that the police were trying to rescue those kidnapped unharmed.
