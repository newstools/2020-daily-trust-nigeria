A staff of the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST), Daniel Ishaku, has been arraigned by the police before a Chief Magistrate Court, Wuse Zone 6, Abuja, over forgery and fraud. The defendant was dragged before the court for allegedly defrauding a cooperative society (Arcuma Multipurpose Cooperative Society Limited) of N1.5 million by forging  a pay slip and an I.D card. The Prosecution Counsel, Peter Ejike, told the court that the defendant had also forged signatures and passport photographs of four NIPOST staff members who are now at large, to defraud the cooperative under the guise of loan. Ejike added that during police investigation, the sum of N150, 000 was recovered from the defendant. He urged the court to try the defendant on a three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, fraud and forgery, contrary to sections 79, 176 and 364 of the Penal Code Law. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The defendant’s counsel, Barr. Obumneme Agbo, in his bail application, promised the court that the defendant would not jump bail. The Magistrate, Ahmed B. Ndajiwo, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N1 million and two reliable sureties and adjourned the case till April 16, 2020.
