A United Kingdom (UK) not-for-profit organisation, Universal Learning Solutions, has launched the Nigerians Educate Everywhere at a Distance (NEED) project in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools have remained shut since the federal and state governments deployed measures to restrict movement in a bid to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus disease in March. A statement by Patrick Uzu, media consultant to the group, said the project would assist states to develop programmes to ensure that children were learning at home whilst schools are closed. “As soon as school closure was announced, Universal Learning Solutions produced a 50-episode Jolly Phonics TV Lessons series to directly benefit Nigerian children. “Nigerian Jolly Phonics trainers recorded a 42 part radio show for the North and South of the country and a free Jolly Phonics Apps and Africa-based Story Reading Apps have been made available on a dedicated website – www.jollphonics.ng – where all the audio, video and App content can be accessed. There is also a range of free worksheets and activities to keep children occupied in the home,” the statement said. Uzu added that Universal Learning Solutions would send messages to as many parents as possible including a full Jolly Phonics lessons course, developed in bite-sized chunks for parents.
