The Lagos State Government yesterday warned private school owners against resuming academic activities for the 2019/2020 session third term via online teaching. The Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo, said all schools in Lagos State remained closed and had not yet been opened for the third term. According to her, resumption by private schools is a strategy for ensuring that students continue to learn while the school calendar continues as planned. She reiterated that the third term resumption remained postponed until directives to the contrary. She said the state continued to offer free teaching on various media, especially radio and television. She said: “The State is presently on lockdown imposed by the Federal Government over the COVID-19 pandemic. Most schools are charging for this online service; often at a discount on existing tuition fees while some schools are charging full fees. Parents are concerned about the cost of this programme, ranging from fees charged by schools to cost of data and devices as well as the cost of fuelling generators to ensure steady electricity power supply. “Parents also have to supervise online teachings to guard against the exposure of children to pornography, in addition to online harassment and bullying.” Schools remain closed, Lagos warns private school owners Abuja parents groan over high school fees Parents grumble over fee hike as schools re-open
