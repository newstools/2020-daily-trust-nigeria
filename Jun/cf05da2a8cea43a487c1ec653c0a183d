The Minneapolis Police Department have confirmed the shooting of 12 people during an overnight melee in Minneapolis. The Police confirmed that that one person died while 11 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Witnesses were quoted as saying that Hennepin Avenue South (scene of the incident) was also the scene of looting and destruction when violence marred the protests against police brutality and the death of George Floyd, who was killed in the same city. Some of the same businesses on the street, which had just finished repairing damage from last month, are now left with shattered windows from the shooting.
