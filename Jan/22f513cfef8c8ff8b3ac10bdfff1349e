The Plateau State government has explained the reason for another budget of N1bn allocated to the Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC), in the 2020 financial year, one year after the commission conducted LG polls in the state. According to the permanent secretary, ministry of finance, Sani Yahaya Mavo, the N1bn captured in the 2020 budget is for the conduct of election in four LGAs where elections were suspended in the last LG elections. Daily Trust reports that the N1bn earmarked for the elections in the four LGAs is captured under administration, a sector responsible for harnessing Human and Financial Resources for the day-to-day running of the state. The sum of N8,308,075000 has been estimated for the sector. PLASIEC had in October 2018 suspended elections in Jos North, Jos South, Riyom and Barikin Ladi LGAs of the state citing insecurity as the reason for the suspension. Mr Mavo disclosed this on Monday at cabinet office while throwing light on the reason behind the new budget allocated to the commission during 2020 state’s budget breakdown, in Jos. “You are all aware that government is yet to conduct elections in four LGAs and the LGAs are run by caretaker committee Chairmen. So, this amount that is allocated in the budget is for conduct of elections in four local government areas to enable the state Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) to get election materials,” he said.
