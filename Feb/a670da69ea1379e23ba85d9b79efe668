The Federal Government said plans have been concluded to collaborate with Global Fortunes Ltd to establish Agricultural Industrial Parks (AIPs) across the six geo-political zones of the country. The Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Mustapha Shehuri, stated this when he received a delegation of the company, led by Mr. Kidron Israel, during a courtesy visit to his office in Abuja. He explained that the project would be a public-private-partnership-driven initiative with a view to creating jobs and ensuring food sufficiency along the agricultural value chains. “Even with the huge infrastructural deficit in Nigeria, we can still embark on this project, because the government is focused on diversifying the Nigerian economy,’’ he said. Shehuri said he would visit the Taraba State Agricultural Industrial Park with the relevant directors to see the model of the park in the state. Also speaking during the meeting, the Director, Department of Agribusiness, Dr. Aminu Babadi, said that the project was a welcome development, noting that some of the challenges that could hinder the smooth take-off of the project include energy and space utilisation.
