A member of the House of Representatives, Olaifa Jimoh Aremu, yesterday raised an alarm over what he called “renewed onslaught on his constituents in  Egbado North/Imeko Afon Federal Constituency in Ogun State by suspected herdsmen.” Aremu, in a statement yesterday, lamented that “no fewer than three cases of attacks were recorded on the Abeokuta-Olorunda- Aiyetoro/Imeko road in the last four days.” He cited cases of an unnamed policewoman reportedly abducted on the road and a driver shot dead, allegedly by herdsmen. The lawmaker expressed worry that “while the people were battling with the troubling effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic, some suspected herdsmen were unleashing terror in the area.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.

One is not oblivious of his tireless efforts, but many people are still calling for his attention in Egbado North/Imeko Afon Federal Constituency, particularly in the areas of security and road rehabilitation, as armed robbers and kidnappers mostly take advantage of the near-impassable roads to attack our helpless people,” he said.
