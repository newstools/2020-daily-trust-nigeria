The FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, yesterday ordered businesses to close by 9pm and open only by 6am the following day starting from today. The minister told journalists said the decision was taken at a meeting of FCTA officials and security agencies where measures taken last week and earlier in the week to fight COVID 19 were reviewed. Bello said the decision was to ensure movement of people is restricted and social distancing protocols observed, as according to him that is the most practically effective way of stopping the spread of coronavirus. “Effective from tomorrow (today), businesses and all commercial activities have been restricted from 9pm to 6am the following day,” the minister said. He further stated that five monitoring teams had been sent to inspect markets, recreational parks, restaurants, pubs, worship centres, motor parks and educational institutions to ensure compliance with the directives of the FCTA on the fight against COVID 19. Bello also said restaurants operating outside of hotels could only serve customers in take-away packs if they do not have enough space for social distancing etiquettes. He said a COVID 19 situation room had been set up and domiciled at the FCT call centre, urging residents to reach out to the FCTA and report untoward behaviour from members of the public and to also get information about the disease. He also said a Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID 19 had been inaugurated and is headed by Dr Umar Modibbo, a former minister of the FCT, with a view to harnessing efforts in combating the pandemic in the nation’s capital.
