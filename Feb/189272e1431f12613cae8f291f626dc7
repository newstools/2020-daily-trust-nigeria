Omidoyin and Tunde Oke, said his right had been violated and grossly infringed upon by the action taken by the Comrade  Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC). The APC chieftain stated that he expressed his interest to vie for the position in a letter dated January 20, 2020, which he forwarded to Ekiti APC to nominate him for the position. This, he attached as exhibit. Apart from Ajimobi and Akinleye, Senator Gbenga Aluko is also contesting for the vacant position and was the preferred candidate from Ekiti APC.
