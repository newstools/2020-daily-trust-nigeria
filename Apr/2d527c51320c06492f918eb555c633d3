A former deputy governor of Edo State, Dr. Pius Odubu, has urged the people of the state and Nigerians to renew their faith in God in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic during the Easter period. Odubu, an aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming governorship in the state, made the call in his Easter message to Edo people. He said more than ever before, the people need each other in love and truth. “This year’s Easter festival is coming at a time the whole world is witnessing a pandemic, the coronavirus, which has brought all nations of the world to their knees with tens of thousands losing their lives,” he said.
