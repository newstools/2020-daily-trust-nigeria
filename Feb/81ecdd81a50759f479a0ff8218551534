The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has organised a sensitisation for its members on the planned implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) in order to improve their access in Sub-Sahara African market. The President of MAN, Engr. Mansur Ahmed, in his address, said the objective of the workshop was to sensitise members on the importance of AfCFTA at the regional level and to enable them share thoughts on other related matters and get inputs from members. Represented by the Vice President of the association, Alhaji Ali Madugu, the MAN president projected that “import will surge in all the manufacturing sectoral groups as tariff cuts trigger increases in import for food, beverages and tobacco by – 91 per cent, chemical and pharmaceutical products 180.7 per cent, plastic and rubber products 111.6 per cent, wood and wood products 96.2 per cent, textile, apparel and footwear 55.2 per cent, non-metallic 67.2 per cent, electrical and electronics 218.2 per cent, motor vehicles and assembly 2,000 per cent”. He further pointed out that Nigeria had huge export market potential in a wide range of goods, especially manufactured products in many countries, including South Africa, Togo, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal and Ghana, when the framework agreement was fully implemented. Engr. Ahmed said MAN took bold steps that almost made the association the lone voice on the African continent using facts and figures to advocate for improvement in operating environment, competitiveness of manufactured products, provision of adjustment costs by the government and the repositioning of the manufacturing sector for a beneficial continental trade. Recalling that, “Nigeria has signed the AfCFTA agreement with great expectation that the country would gain from the free trade arrangement and not suffer too much losses,” the industrialist urged the participants to share their thoughts during the interaction that would produce balanced position that would enable the association firm up advocacy roadmap and appropriate business advisory service for members in readiness for the implementation of AfCFTA. 44 countries sign Africa’s trade pact Why Buhari put AU trade deal on hold Buhari receives report on AfCFTA January
