The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has said it had neither registered nor approved Pax herbal remedy for the treatment of COVID-19. Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories had in a recent advertorial claimed that it had developed a new drug called PAX CVD PLUS for the treatment of COVID-19, and was working with NAFDAC to speed up approval for the use of the drugs. The advertorial had also claimed that the Director-General of NAFDAC had appointed experts to work with PAXHERBAL on the  project. However, Director General of NAFDAC, Prof Mojisola Christianah Adeyeye,  in a statement said PAX CVD PLUS had neither been registered nor listed for treatment of COVD-19, and had equally not registered or listed any other remedy for COVID-19.
