The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it accepted Governor Godwin Obaseki as its candidate because of his financial discipline in managing the state’s resources. Chief Dan Orbih, PDP National Vice Chairman, (South South), stated this at the weekend in Benin while speaking with journalists. “I can tell you that what made the All Progressives Congress (APC) to lose Obaseki, which is his financial discipline, is the very reason PDP accepted him as governorship candidate,” he said. According to him, the widely held view by leaders of APC in Edo State that Obaseki was not bringing money for them to share after they worked for him in the 2016 election endeared him to the leaders of the PDP. “It is surprising that the same people who said Obaseki will not allow state money to be shared are the people now saying that Obaseki shared money and that is why PDP accepted him. “So, you can see that there is a lot of insincerity in this attempt to taint him (Obaseki) in very bad light,” he said.
