Governor Aminu Masari has said his administration is ready to conduct local government election if there is a clear pronouncement on their case now before the Supreme Court. The opposition PDP and the APC administration are at loggerheads over the dissolution of local councils which case is now before the Supreme Court. Only last week, the state PDP chairman, Salisu Majigiri, said they are looking forward to the state governor implementing a recent Supreme Court judgment on LGAs by reinstating sacked councils officials. Masari, at a media chat said, “The fact that some pronouncements are made somewhere, they don’t directly affect Katsina State unless there is pronouncement from the Supreme Court, on our own case. “So I think I consider it to be one of those stories. And circumstances are different. What kills somebody here maybe a different disease that killed somebody there. The fact that some other states have dissolved local government and they said take them back, does not mean what we did is the same. Maybe they did not follow the law,” he said. Masari explained further, “We followed the law that was enacted by our predecessors to dissolve the local government councils. So until and unless there is a clear pronouncement on our own case that is before the Supreme Court, before we can decide. “But I assure you that today, if there is a positive declaration by the Supreme Court, we would not take more than three months to have election; because we are ready. As far as we are concerned, we are ready for election. So we are not even afraid of it. “It is their law. We inherited the law, we used it and now they are challenging the same law that they passed in the court.”  Katsina PDP drags Masari to Supreme Court over LG transition committees Why we can’t conduct LG polls — Masari Battling for the soul of Anambra
