The national president of the Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), Alhaji Aliyu Oroji Wamako, has condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari and the entire nation on the death of the Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, who died of coronavirus yesterday. Wamako, in a statement yesterday, described the late Chief of Staff as a cerebral lawyer, outstanding politician and distinguished statesman who served the nation dutifully. Aliyu said Kyari’s death was a huge loss to the nation in view of his hard work and commitment to the success of Buhari’s administration in the last six years. According to him, Kyari’s death is a clear confirmation that COVID-19 is a reality and not an hoarse as being erroneously considered in some quarters. He, therefore, urged Nigerians to adhere strictly to all the preventive measures put in place by the health authorities to be safe from the deadly virus. Aliyu prayed Allah to grant Buhari, the presidency and the family of the deceased the fortitude to bear the loss, and the late Abba Kyari, eternal rest in Al -Janar Firdaus.
