Dufil Prima Foods Plc, makers of Indomie Instant noodles, has donated the sum of 4 million to ‘Save Our Art, Save Our Heritage’, a campaign designed to safeguard the artistic treasures of Osun-Osogbo grove. The N4 million donation is the second tranche of an earlier pledged N20million support to be disbursed over a period of five years. The Osun-Osogbo grove is a UNESCO World Heritage site where tourists and art lovers visit to see monumental sculptures created by the renowned artist, Susanne Wenger, in collaboration with local Osogbo artists: Adebisi Akanji, Rabiu Abesu, Kasali Akangbe-Ogun and others. Unique sculptures at the site exemplify the artists’ commitment to creating art that reflects the intrinsic culture and traditions of Osun-Osogbo. Presenting the cheque of N4m on behalf of Dufil Prima Foods Plc to the representatives of Susanne Wenger Adunni Olorisha Trust (AOT), the Group Public Relations and Events Manager of Dufil, Mr. Tope Ashiwaju described the donation as one of the brand’s ways of promoting and protecting the cultural heritage and traditions in Nigeria during the trying period of the coronavirus pandemic. According to Ashiwaju, Nigeria has one of the richest cultures in the world, which has given it global recognition. The donation, he said will help to ensure that the remarkable legacy of heritage, art and nature are preserved, promoted and celebrated both in Nigeria and internationally. Receiving the N4 million on behalf of AOT, Volunteer Co-Chair, Robin Campbell, said the gesture would go a long way in helping to preserve the art in the grove and protect Wenger’s works. The objective of the AOT, he said, is to ensure that the artwork created by the New Sacred Art Movement is preserved with high artistic standards and to recognise and encourage new artists.
