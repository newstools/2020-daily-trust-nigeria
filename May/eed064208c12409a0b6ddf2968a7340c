He cautioned banks against embarking on precipitate action that will shake the confidence of skilled personnel and a possible Exodus from the critical industry. “Once the sector becomes associated with job insecurity, it will be very difficult to attract bright and highly skilled professionals. This is capable of leading to loss of public confidence and instability in the system,” the senator warned. Assuring that COVID-19 is a passing phase, Uba Sani said, “we must remain calm and be at our innovative best. Panicky measures will do us no good. Let’s think and act strategically.” Senate c'ttee chair gets finance institution award Senate committee screens Obiora for CBN post Senate confirms Obiora as CBN dep gov, Hassan as NAHCON chair
