Protesters under the aegis of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) North West Concern Forum yesterday petitioned the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) demanding the removal of Ambassador Ibrahim Kazaure as North West zonal chairman of the party. The protesters led by Abubakar A. Rafindadi stormed the PDP National Secretariat and besieged the main entrance chanting songs that Kazaure should be removed from office over alleged anti-party activities. The petition dated March 12, 2020, was addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, titled “Petition on the Unscrupulous Action and Anti-Party Activities of Senator Ibrahim Musa Kazaure’.” Reading to the petition, leader of the protesters, Rafindadi, alleged that since Kazaure assumed office as zonal chairman in 2016, he had not called for a zonal meeting to discuss crucial issues affecting the party. But reacting to the development, Secondus told newsmen that the party would handle the issue internally.
