Reacting to the development, the impeached chairman said they (councillors) had no constitutional power to sack him, stressing that since the matter was before a court, no action should be taken pending the determination of the substantive suit. He said he approached the court after his purported suspension. “On the allegations that contracts were executed and payments made without council’s resolution, I can tell you that I have never awarded any contract in office,” Ahmad Maradun said.
