The newly elected member of Sokoto State House of Assembly, Alhaji Abubakar Adamu (PDP, Kebbe constituency) was sworn-in yesterday. He was elected in last Saturday’s by-election conducted following the death of Alhaji Isa Harisu in December last year. With his inauguration, the 30-member State Assembly now has 15 members each from the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). APC hitherto had the majority with 16 members while PDP had 14. The swearing-in of the new lawmaker was sequel to a motion by Majority Leader Alhaji Bello Ambarura (APC-Illela). The newly sworn-in Adamu told journalists that he would ensure more development for his constituency and Sokoto State. 7 months on: Sokoto PDP-led executive, APC–steered legislature defy doomsayers Youths make inroads as state assembly speakers emerge 64 senators, 151 reps fail to return to N/Assembly
