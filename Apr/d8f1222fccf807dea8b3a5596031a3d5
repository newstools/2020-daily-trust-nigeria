Small holder farmers under the aegis of Association of Small Scale Agro Producers in Nigeria (ASSAPIN), has appealed for special intervention to avert food shortage in the country. The National president of the association, Mr Joshua Jonathan, made the appeal to governments and other stakeholders on Monday in Lafia, Nasarawa State. Jonathan was quoted in a report sourced from the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) as saying that with the outbreak of COVID-19 and the attendant lockdown at the beginning of the farming season, food crisis is looming in the country. He cautioned: “If nothing is done quickly in terms of special intervention for our rural poor farmers, because the farming season is just starting, there would be food crisis. This is because if you can’t produce and you finish what you had produced, then there would be serious problem” The ASSAPIN leader urged governments at all levels to initiate programmes that will be targeted at smallholder farmers for the provision of farm inputs such as improved seeds, fertilizers and agro chemicals. As a step towards mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic on rural farmers, Jonathan also urged the authorities to exempt farmers and agro chemical dealers from the government’s restriction order to enable them go to their farms. Jonathan maintained that farming activities does not promote large gathering, hence the issue of social distancing to curtail the spread of the virus would be upheld by farmers. He charged farmers and all citizens to take precautionary measures by government and relevant authorities seriously as COVID-19 pandemic remains real.
