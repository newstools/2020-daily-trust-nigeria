The Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) said all the executive and other council officials who tested for the COVID-19  recently, came out with  negative results. City News reported last week how the council secretariat was ordered to be shut down by its chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu Candido, following the contraction of the disease by the secretary. In a statement issued by Head of Information of the council, Patience Olaloye,  and made available to our reporter on Sunday, Candido said following the incident last Tuesday, all members of the council executives and other officials led by the chairman, had undergone the COVID 19 test and the results were released during the weekend. The statement further stated that Candido ordered that all the COVID 19 safety procedures in the council be strictly adhered to in order to ensure the safety of all members of staff and that of visitors to the facility. He equally prayed for speedy recovery of the council secretary while enjoining residents of AMAC  to remain calm and continue to pray for God’s intervention in the matter.
