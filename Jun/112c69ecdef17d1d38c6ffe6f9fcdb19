A former Governor of old Kaduna State, Alhaji Barabe Musa, has said that the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) still remains an alternative to the APC and the PDP. In an interview, the former governor said, “Now that the PDP and APC have lost credibility throughout the country because of their incompetence both at national and state levels, we can use that to demonstrate to Nigerians that PRP of the progressives still remains an alternative to PDP and APC. “We still have hope because the success of June 12, coupled with the recognition of the government in power, is a good indication that if we continue the struggle we will achieve our objective, particularly now that those who annulled June 12 who now lead the PDP and the APC have lost credibility throughout the country because of their incompetence both at national and state levels. We can use that to demonstrate to Nigerians that PRP of the progressives still remains an alternative to PDP and APC.” Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch.
