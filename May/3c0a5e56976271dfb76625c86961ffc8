The FCT police command has commenced the enforcement of curfew in the territory between 8: pm and 6:am daily, in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. A statement by the command’s spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manza, said the enforcement of the curfew was as a result of the presidential directive imposing overnight curfew in the territory. He said the curfew implied that movement of persons will not be allowed within the stipulated time, even as he said essential service providers, especially medical personnel, who may be on duty at such hours, will be considered. The command therefore called on members of the public to comply with the presidential directive and stay at home within the curfew hours.
