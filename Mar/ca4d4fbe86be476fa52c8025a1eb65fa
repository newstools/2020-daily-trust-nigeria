The Nigeria Air Force has assured Ekiti State government of its readiness to partner with the state government on its agro-allied airport project. The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubarkar, who made this known during a visit to Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, hinted on the readiness to establish a security unit at the airport when it becomes fully operational. Air Marshal Abubakar, who together with top officials of the Force had a meeting with Governor Fayemi and his team, said the visit was in continuation of the meeting the Governor had with him at the Force Headquarters, Abuja last month, in respect of the cargo airport. The Air Force Chief said the Force would continue to do everything humanly possible to ensure that the country is secured. He said President Mohammadu Buhari was passionate about the security of the country, adding that this accounted for the establishment of about 13 units of the Force in different parts of the country, in addition to acquisition of more aircrafts in the last four and a half years. Earlier, Governor Fayemi had disclosed that the establishment of the cargo airport would not only trigger local economy but provide support for the utilization of the medical and biomedical resources available in the State.
