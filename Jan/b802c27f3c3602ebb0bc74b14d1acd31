The Speaker, Kwara state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Salihu Danladi has decried the artificial scarcity of fuel, which resulted to hike in price of petroleum products in his immediate local government area, Baruten. This was contained in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Ibrahim Sheriff where he said the lawmaker disclosed the situation in border communities on Monday during a meeting with the Acting Coordinator, Joint Border Drill, Sector 3, Kwara Customs, Comptroller U G Mohammed. The Speaker, who was accompanied by his counterpart from Okuta/Yashikira constituency of Baruten local government, noted that the artificial fuel scarcity in Baruten Local Government is majorly caused by Federal Government’s efforts towards checkmating smugglers who divert petroleum products allocated to filling stations in the area to neighboring countries. He said “the sufferings of our people in Baruten communities is a result of the inordinate execution of Federal Government order banning fuel supply to filling stations located 20 kilometers or below from border communities to checkmate smuggling activities. “As much as this step by the Federal Government is in good faith and supported by the Kwara state House of Assembly, we however noticed that security operatives in our communities, which are on the border routes, seize petroleum products lawfully allocated to communities like Ilesha, Sinawu, Gwanara among others with no direct route to the 20 kilometers from the country’s border. “Consequently, at the moment, a litre of petrol is sold for as high as between N300-N350, that is why it is rarely available.” He therefore called on the Nigeria Customs Service to look into the matter and allow communities located in areas farther than the 20 kilometers federal government benchmark to take petroleum products lawfully allocated to their filling stations to enable the people access the products and ameliorate their suffering.
