Two-thirds of the 30,003 deaths from coronavirus have now been recorded in Europe. More than 640,770 declared cases have been registered in 183 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December. Of these cases, at least 130,600 are now considered recovered. The tallies, using data collected by AFP offices from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), likely reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are now only testing cases that require hospitalisation. Since 1900 GMT Friday, there have been 3,417 new deaths and 68,734 new cases confirmed worldwide. The countries with the most deaths over the last 24 hours were Italy with 889, Spain with 832 and the United States with 453.
