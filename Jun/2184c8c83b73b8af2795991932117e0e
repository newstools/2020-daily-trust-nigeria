Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), have arrested a 32-year-old man, Boniface Oburuku, in Lagos for alleged theft of a handbag belonging to an international guest from the Republic of Mauritius. The bag was said to be containing the guest’s two mobile phones, an international passport, United States dollars, and Nigerian and Mauritian currencies.  Oburuku allegedly committed the crime on June 11, 2019 at an event organised by the EFCC to mark the year’s National Democracy Day and Anti-Corruption Summit at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, which had in attendance President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerian security chiefs, respected citizens and global leaders. For over one year, the suspect had been on the Commission’s watch list but was eventually arrested in Lagos a few days ago. Narrating how the suspect was tracked down, the team leader, Counter-Terrorism and General Investigations Unit of the EFCC said the Commission swung into action through an intelligence on the suspect, which showed that he was constantly on the move, from Mpape to Jabi and Gwagwalada areas of the Federal Capital Territory. He finally settled in Lagos, where he was arrested. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. Investigations also revealed that to breach security at the day’s event, Oburuku dressed smartly in a black suit and claimed to be of the Department of State Security (DSS) and was allowed access into the venue by security agents on duty without presentation of an invitation card. Confessing to the crime, the suspect apologised to President Buhari, the EFCC and his Mauritian victim. The EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale, said yesterday that the suspect would soon be charged to court.
