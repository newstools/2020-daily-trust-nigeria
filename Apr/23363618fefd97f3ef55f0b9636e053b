The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, says with the implementation of measures that will be rolled out soon, Nigeria can avoid a negative growth of 3.4% in 2021 as predicted by the International Monetary Fund. She based her optimism on the assessment of the National Bureau of Statistics. Addressing State House reporters yesterday after a meeting of the Economic Sustainability Committee chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, she said the global economy would go into recession in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging countries across the world. She said: “But if we take all these measures that we are planning now, we’ll be able to by 2021 go back into positive growth. That’s why this is very important.” The minister said the committee would in the next couple of days finalize its report and submit it to President Muhammadu Buhari. She said the stimulus package being worked out by the Economic Sustainability Committee would be approved by President Muhammadu Buhari before it would be announced to Nigerians. “We’re looking at various ways and means to support each sector of the economy, providing for each sector clear interventions that would be designed for the primary purpose of creating jobs and ensuring that businesses stay afloat during these difficult times,” she added.
