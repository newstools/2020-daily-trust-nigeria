Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has inaugurated a 15-member committee to increase the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the state. He said while inaugurating the committee in Lafia that the initiative was borne out of his administration’s determination to improve the revenue profile of the State. According to him, “This is to provide us with sumptuous alternative sources of revenue generation as a vista for improved expenditure on projects, programs and policies geared towards the overall development of our dear state.” Governor Sule said the only way to galvanize the state’s economy was by strengthening all revenue accruing sources. The governor also said the constitution of the committee was in line with the Nasarawa Economic Development Strategy, (NEDS) and to enhance the socio-economic deliverables of the state. “This is with a twin goal of harnessing our economic potentials vis-à-vis human resources as formidable frontiers that can elevate the state to enviable heights.” “Nasarawa is one of the richest states in the country, but the state continues to be like a beggar waiting for allocation from the Federal Government to survive, whereas we can survive on our own. I, therefore, task this committee to please work and take Nasarawa State out of the woods from being a beggarly to a prosperous state,” he said. Gov.
