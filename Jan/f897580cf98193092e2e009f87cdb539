Ahead of January 25 re-run election for Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe federal constituency of Imo state, some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have accused the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba of engaging in anti-party activities. Nwajiuba, who won the House of Representatives seat in Ehime Mbano/Ihitte Uboma/Obowo federal constituency on the platform of the Accord Party was sacked by a court after he was inaugurated as a member of the National Assembly and replaced with Chike Okafor of the APC. He was later appointed a minister by President Muhammadu Buhari. The APC State Deputy Youth Leader, Hon. Christogonus Chidi Unezeh, told our correspondent that Nwajiuba was working against the party by supporting the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because of his closeness to Governor Emeka Ihedioha. The party chieftain alleged that Nwajiuba was favouring the PDP candidate in the rerun instead of his party’s candidate. Unezeh claimed that the minister was also nursing plans to join the PDP in case the first option failed. When contacted, the State APC chairman, Dan Nwafor, though said Nwajiuba had been absent from its activities, it was not a sign of anti-party activity. However, the PDP State Organising Secretary, Mr Damian Opara, said that the party would be happy to welcome Nwajiuba into its fold.
