Governors of the 36 states of the federation yesterday unanimously agreed to the implementation of an inter-state lockdown over the next two weeks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. They reached the agreement after receiving briefing from the governors of Lagos, Bauchi, Oyo and Ogun States who shared their experiences and lessons in the fight against COVID-19. A communiqué issued by the Nigeria Governors’  Forum’s chairman and Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi after the sixth COVID-19 teleconference meeting said only essential services would be permitted. The forum called for decentralization of the COVID-19 response as the best chance of halting the spread of the virus in communities with over 25 states affected and increasing evidence of community transmission. The NGF expressed serious concern over the rising infection among health workers and resolved to work with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to provide them with adequate personal protective equipment and constantly train them on the use of protective gears. The governors also resolved to set up COVID-19 committees at the regional level to be headed by their Commissioners for Health to strengthen coordinated implementation of necessary public health recommendations across states. The NGF congratulated Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai on his recovery from coronavirus infection. The forum condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari and the people of Borno State on the passing of his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, who died of coronavirus complications on Friday.
