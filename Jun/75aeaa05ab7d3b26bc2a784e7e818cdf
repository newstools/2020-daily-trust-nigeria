The Creative Director of Èlan Clothiers, makers of Afro-centric work wear for the professional woman, Funke Oloyede, has said a simple shift from physical training to online training helped to sustain her business throughout the lockdown, as well as reduced operational cost by about 30 per cent. Oloyede who also runs a fashion training institute, explained that during the lockdown, the clothing production aspect of her business was totally shut down while she shifted her training classes from physical to online. During the period, her business, she said, recorded positive results from the online training with same number of students’ progress as physical classes, even though she had about 70 per cent reduction in her monthly income. She said, “The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic was the biggest challenge faced in my business so far, especially because it happened almost unexpectedly. So I generally can’t say I had enough measures in place to deal with it at the time. I had to dip into prior savings to cater for basic day-to-day operations.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
