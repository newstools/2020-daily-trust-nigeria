The Chief Medical Director of Kuje General Hospital, Dr Oscar Udofia, yesterday disclosed that government has commenced upgrade of some facilities in the hospital. Udofia stated this at the hospital premises while receiving two delivery beds and one air conditioner from Soroptimist International, Asokoro, a Non-Governmental Organisation, advocating for women and girl-child education led by its Charter President, Dr Victoria Pillah. The CMD, who was flanked by other medical personnel in the hospital, told reporters that despite challenges of coronavirus pandemic, no fewer than 150 women give birth every month – a situation he said had put pressure on the facilities in the labour wards. “Last time, when the minister of State for FCT, Hajia Ramatu Tijani, visited us, she gave an assurance that federal government would help in upgrading some medical equipment here, we thank them for looking our way,” he said.

She added: “Last week, SI Asokoro distributed palliatives to members of Gaube community to cushion the effect of COVID-19, we would have done the same distribution of palliatives here today, but we decided to embark on a more long lasting project that will outlive us, hence the donation of beds and air conditioner that will still be useful after COVID-19 pandemic. “We shall, however, continue to have General Hospital, Kuje in mind from time to time as things improve”.
