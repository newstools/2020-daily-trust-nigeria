The executive officers of the Bankole Odegbami Efunleye Talabi Estate (BOET), Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja, has promised to continue executing projects that would make the estate more habitable and convenient for property owners and residents. The officers issued the promise at the maiden end-of-year party organized by the estate, where residents and property owners came together to wine and dine. The residents include THE SUN Nigeria newspaper. It was a lot of fun and excitement as two separate parties were held for the children and adults last weekend. The Secretary of the estate association, Mr Paul Falegon, told our correspondent that the get-together was aimed at uniting residents of the estate. Falegon said the new executive members of the association would continue to provide a conducive atmosphere for residents through the provision of infrastructure facilities. Our correspondent gathered that in 2019, the association executed several projects like the construction of bad portions of roads within the state, street lights and beautification of the estate gate. The Secretary, who disclosed that the street lights were being powered by a dedicated generator, added that the association intends to install closed- circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the state to monitor movement in and out of the estate at night and further improve the security of the estate.
