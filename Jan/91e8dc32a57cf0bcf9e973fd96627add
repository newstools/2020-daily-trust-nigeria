Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, will visit the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) and Bureau for Public Enterprise (BPE), both in Abuja, in a move to expedite work on the ongoing power substation in Akurba, a suburb of Lafia. Governor Sule disclosed this shortly after undertaking an inspection tour of the power plant yesterday. The governor said it had become necessary to visit the two agencies in Abuja in order to facilitate work on the 330KVA substation that would be transformed to 33KVA to be distributed across the state. He expressed satisfaction with the pace of the ongoing work, with the main power substation presently at 85 per cent completion. “Hopefully, we will go and see if we can discuss with the officials concerned to expedite action on the contract award, because that is the most important part of the project right now,” the governor said. According to the governor, once the substation is completed, the state will be powered, with the six lines going to Lafia, Akwanga, Doma, Assakio, Keana, Obi and other parts of the zone.
