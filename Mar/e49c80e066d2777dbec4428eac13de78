The Association of Hajj and Umrah Operators of Nigeria in Kano have appealed to the federal government to capture its members in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), N50 billion COVID-19 palliatives designed for hoteliers, airlines, service providers and health merchants. Speaking during an interactive session with newsmen in Kano, the Zonal Chairman of the association, Alhaji Abdullaziz Halliru Kafinsoli, revealed that the outbreak of COVID-19 has seriously affected their businesses. According to him, the recent suspension of flights into Saudi Arabia by Saudi authorities, has affected their businesses causing a lot of losses to their investment that covers millions of dollars, adding that as Nigerians operating lawful businesses, they are also entitled to partake in the CBN incentive considering the huge amount of revenue they generate for the country. “We have gone through the CBN N50 billion incentive offer, but we are not all that optimistic of benefitting from it because we have not been consulted. “The federal government should consider our members because we are the worse hit in this COVID-19 problem. “When policies like this are made, our members should be captured considering the amount of turnover and revenue we generate for the federal government through our business,” he said.
