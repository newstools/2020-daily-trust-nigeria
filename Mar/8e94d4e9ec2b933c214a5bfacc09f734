The Federal Government says it is not imposing travel ban on travellers over the spread of Coronavirus pandemic yet. The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehinare, said this yesterday in Abuja at a meeting with members of diplomatic corps. The meeting was organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ehinare said the country had not reached the point of banning large gathering and was guided by World Health Organisation’s guideline. He, however, warned Nigerians against travelling to endemic countries, including China, Japan, Italy, South Korea and Iran.
