The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission yesterday insisted that there is no immediate tariff increase till it holds public consultation for electricity consumers under the 11 power Distribution Companies (DisCos). In a statement by the General Manager, Public Affairs Department, Dr. Usman Abba Arabi, the Commission said: “The minor review Order released by the Commission on January 3, 2020 has no immediate impact on end-user tariffs payable by all classes of electricity customers in the country.” NERC said the Order has further prescribed minimum market remittance threshold payable by the 11 DisCos and the ‘projected tariff path until 2021’. “However, where actual end-user tariffs are likely to be impacted by the review, the required public and stakeholder consultations shall be implemented,” it said. Although NERC failed to say when the rise will begin contrary to the DisCos’ orders, its Chairman, Prof. James Momoh signed stipulating an expected increase from April 2020. Standing on the signed tariff orders, the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED) on Monday said the increase will start April. Spokesman of ANED, Chief Sunday Oduntan in a statement said, “the tariffs shall remain the same as they presently are (i.e. 2015 levels) until April 01, 2020 when there will be a slight increment to cater for tariff shortfalls which shall be gradually passed on to the consumer until this is fully completed by the end of 2021.’’ Electricity: No tariff increase until consumers are consulted, NERC says We didn't approve tariff hike in new order — NERC FG approves 5 electricity tariff reviews as customers groan
