The Presidency says the closure of land borders in the country has provided jobs for teeming Nigerian youths and improved the country’s revenue generation. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger-Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang Enang, said this in a statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Edet Ekpenyong Etuk. Enang, according to the statement, said this while fielding questions from journalists after a strategic meeting in his office in Abuja. “Many people who have been out of jobs are now taking to rice, cassava, millet farming etc. So, the closure has positively increased the revenue generation of the country,” Enang said. He challenged the south-south governors to support the border closure by investing in agriculture. Enang said Buhari should be commended for creating food security and restoring peace, especially in volatile areas.
