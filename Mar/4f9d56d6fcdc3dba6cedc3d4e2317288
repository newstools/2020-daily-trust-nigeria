The North East Development Association (NEDA) has urged governors in the zone to sustain their efforts towards restoring lasting peace in the region. The association made the appeal on Monday in Abuja. NEDA Secretary-General Bitako Umar commended the governors for the steps they took to curb insurgency and other criminal activities that had deterred growth and development in the zone. “In the same vein, we urge them to maintain that spirit and relentlessly sustain it as it is the only way that solutions to the lingering insecurity challenges can be overcome,” Umar said. He said NEDA had observed, in recent times, the efforts of the North East Development Commission,  humanitarian activities and quick responses to crises in the zone, particularly after the Auno and Garkida attacks. He said, “Their proposed Educational Endowment Scheme and Skills Acquisitions Training Programs are all fantastic, and should be properly implemented by reaching the less privileged and target groups.”
