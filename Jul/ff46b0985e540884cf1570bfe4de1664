“They are everywhere: in heaps on the roadside, in your neighbourhood, in wedges balanced on trays. But those big green things, sweet reddish on the inside, pack a whole lot more punch for your average fruit. Here’s how watermelon helps you. Sight. Just a medium slice gives you more than 10% of the vitamin you need daily. Vitamin A helps your eyes to stay healthy. You may get it as tablets but foods are the best way to get all the vitamins and minerals you need. Hydration. Get seriously dehydrated and you could need an IV. Your cells need water to stay active. And watermelon is 92% water, so it is a sweet and natural source. Calorie counting. A cup of ice cream will leave you with 300 calories to deal with. The same amount of watermelon leaves you with only 45.6 calories. And unlike your other deserts, watermelon is fat free, low in cholesterol and has no sodium. Workout. Watermelon’s high water content, antioxidants, and amino acids may make for a better workout. It’s also high in potassium, a mineral that could cut down on cramps at the gym. You can sip watermelon juice after you sweat, too. Doing so could help prevent muscle soreness, as long as you don’t push yourself too hard. Blood sugar. Trying to keep your blood glucose levels steady? You’re in luck. Watermelon has a glycaemic index (GI) value of 80, about the same as a bowl of cornflakes. But it’s got few carbs. That means its glycaemic load (how quickly it enters your bloodstream and how much glucose it can produce) is a mere five. Enjoy a slice without guilt! Digestible. If you have a digestive condition like Crohn’s or colitis, the list of what not to eat during a flare can be long. You can put watermelon on your “yes” list. Its soft, fleshy fruit is easy for even an inflamed gut to digest. (Just don’t eat the rind or the seeds if you need to limit fibre.) Courtesy: Kathleen Zelman PROBLEM: Dry skin?
