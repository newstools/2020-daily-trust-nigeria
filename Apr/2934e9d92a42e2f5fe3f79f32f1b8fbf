Some Damaturu residents have expressed fear as Gombe State government on Tuesday deported 125 Almajirai as part of measures to curb the spread of the COVIC-19 in the country. Our correspondent gathered that all the deported Almajirai had claimed Yobe as their place of origin with majority of them from Fika, Potiskum and Fune local government areas (LGAs). However, the fear among residents stemmed from the fact that five among the recently returned Almajirai from Kano to Kaduna had tested positive for COVID-19. Residents said they suspected that some of the deported Almajirai might have contracted the new virus. Idriss Geidam, who spoke with our reporter, expressed shocked about the development. Meanwhile, the Executive Director, Networks for Civil Societies, Yobe State, Alhaji Baba Shehu, has advised the state government not to release the deportees without observing all necessary protocols.
