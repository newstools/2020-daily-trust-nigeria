The Bauchi State Government has dispelled the rumours being peddled by some mischief makers suggesting that the state Governor, Bala Muhammed is bed-ridden and cannot be back anytime soon to continue to perform his official duties. A statement signed by Senior Special Assistant on Media to the Governor, Mukhtar Gidado said,  “Some members of the opposition have in the wake of the on-going Supreme Court case, unfortunately insinuated that the governor is in the United Kingdom for the ‘long haul’ because of what they term to be his deteriorating health condition. Daily Trust recalled that on Sunday evening in a statement, Gidado relayed the message of the governor from London. The statement reads “I am in hospital in London  but we strongly believe that Allah is sufficient for us and He is Able and Capable to give us victory! Cheers, success shall be ours InshaAllah! Cheers to you all.” The statement said that the governor will soon take drastic action to get rid of saboteurs and ungrateful people within his midst, adding that many unexpected opponents and opposition have emerged to pull his administration down through the supreme court but expressed confidence that they will fail. Gidado in the latest statement said, “I wish to state that this dubious line of thought exists only in the wicked and diabolical world of the rumour merchants. Our Governor was away on medical appointment with his Doctor, had a minor procedure and returned to his temporary abode same day. He even had a Road Walk barely 3 hours after the procedure.” “Those who are active on social media must have seen a picture His Excellency personally posted, looking rested and cheerful. I can confirm to the good people of Bauchi State that our  Governor will be joining us soon as he personally indicated in a Social Media feed this morning.
