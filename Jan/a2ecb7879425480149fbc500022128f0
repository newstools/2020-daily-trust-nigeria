A former Minister of Communication, Barr. Adebayo Shittu, has urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to put its house in order and get an acceptable presidential candidate for the next election, saying President Muhammadu Buhari will not seek a third term. Barr. Shittu spoke yesterday in Osogbo while featuring on a programme organised by Association of Veteran Journalists, Osun State chapter. The programme, which was tagged “the Frontliners”, held at the press center of the Osun State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ). The minister, who said the rumor that President Buhari would seek a third term in office was idiotic, insisted that the President is not the kind of person that would make such attempt. He said Buhari remained an incorruptible leader and that the issue of tenure is a constitutional matter which the president cannot change on his own. He said Buhari remained “the magnet” that can give the APC victory in the next presidential election, adding that the party must get it right so that the president would endorse and support the candidate of the party. Shittu, who was a gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the APC in Oyo State in the last election, said the party lost to the PDP because of the poor attitude of the immediate past governor Abiola Ajimobi. He said Ajimobi denied him the ticket of the party because he was wanted to curb his influence by all means in view of his closeness to President Buhari. He lauded the incumbent governor of Oyo State, Mr Seyi Makinde, for abolishing the school fees imposed on the primary school pupils in the state which made it difficult for the children of poor to go to school during the tenure of Ajimobi.  2019 Presidency: Strong signals Buhari’ll run again Minister, Marwa urge FCT residents to vote Buhari Election aftermath: Oshiomhole in fresh trouble
