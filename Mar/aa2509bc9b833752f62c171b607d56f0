Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday underscored the need to get private sector interest along with government to bring power to Kano State. Osinbajo said this while receiving a delegation from the Kano Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture led by its president, Alhaji Dalhatu Abubakar, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. “If we can bring substantial amount of investment in power to Kano, we can really make a difference. So, I am looking forward to working with you on power,” he said in a statement issued by his spokesman, Laolu Akande. Osinbajo, who stressed the need for closer collaboration between KACCIMA and the Federal Government, said: “anyone who understands the history of business in Nigeria cannot in any way diminish the importance of the Kano business community. “As a matter of fact when we started the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council, in engaging the partnership that will help us, Lagos and Kano had to be the two focal points for the implementation of our reform plans. “We must establish a way of collaborating, where we look at specific measures on how to advance solutions to the numerous problems that are facing us.” Osinbajo said the regular interface between the private sector and the Federal Government would continue because of their contribution to the development of the economy, especially in creating employment. He said the federal government would do everything possible to support the business community in Kano.
