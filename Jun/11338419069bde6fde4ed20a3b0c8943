She further said some negative decisions made by man had brought about unprecedented changes in nature, adding that, “One of these is COVID-19.” She said despite the challenges, medical practitioners had been working tirelessly to ensure the safety of Nigerians, hence the donation. While receiving the items, Dr. Ernest Onuigbo, who represented the Chief Medical Consultant of the hospital, commended the group for the donation, adding that it would help in the discharge of their duties. Among items donated were 350 face masks, 400 bottles of hand sanitiser, seven packs of PPEs, 40 litres of liquid soap and two thermometers.
