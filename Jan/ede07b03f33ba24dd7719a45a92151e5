Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has blamed “hostile transition” caused by his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun and the legal battles which trailed his election as reasons why his administration started on a slow pace. Abiodun also said as a governor coming from a private sector, he deliberately took his time to choose those who have the capacity and experience to help realise his vision for the state. He spoke in Abeokuta, the state capital, while inaugurating the 48-man Governor’s Elders Advisory Council (GEAC) chaired by Chief Olu Okuboyejo. Abiodun said: “As we go on, you will find me more available than I’ve been in the past and the reason for that is very simple; the first few months of this administration, we spent in settling down and I do not need to remind us how hostile the takeover was and how turbulent the journey has been. “It took other governors one election. They only won one election, for me I won an election and I have to win in court three times. While doing that I was also trying to be very meticulous in choosing the team that would work with me, particularly in the areas that are very sensitive. “And I think in my own experience in the private sector, when you take over a company, it is not something that happens overnight, for instance, in the area of choosing the chief operating officers from different units.” How Ogun commissioners’ list sparks off fresh controversy in APC Ogun gov-elect narrates ‘not too sweet’ experience Inside Abiodun’s seven months in Ogun
