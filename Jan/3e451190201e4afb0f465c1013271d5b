The Trump administration plans to add seven countries to a group of nations subject to travel restrictions, including Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, along with others in Africa and Asia, according to administration officials who have seen the list, reports The Wall Street Journal. The new restrictions would apply to travelers and immigrants from Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. The countries wouldn’t necessarily face blanket bans on travel to the U.S., but could have restrictions placed on specific types of visas, such as business or visitor visas, reported the paper quoting an administration officials. Some countries could be banned from participating in the diversity visa lottery program, which awards green cards to people in countries with low levels of immigration to the U.S. President Trump has called for an end to that program, saying it lets undesirable people into the U.S., and he has proposed reorienting the existing visa system toward skilled workers instead. The officials said the list isn’t final, and on Tuesday the White House was still debating whether to include one or two of the countries. The restrictions are used to encourage countries to comply with US national security requirements, such as sharing information with US agencies, noted an official of the administration. The administration plans to roll out its expanded travel restrictions on Monday, marking the three-year anniversary of the initial travel ban Mr. Trump signed on his seventh day in office, sparking controversy at the beginning of his term. The administration has said its policy restricting travel is necessary to prevent potential acts of terrorism, as countries on the list don’t adequately vet their travelers to the U.S. New US visa fees as push for Trump’s policy on Africa Visa ban not targeted at newly elected government — US Embassy Saraki urges Qatari govt to end visa restriction on Nigerians
