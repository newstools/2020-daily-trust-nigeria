The Niger State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the state House of Assembly to commence impeachment process against Governor Sani Bello over deteriorating security situation in the state. The state chairman of the party, Barr. Tanko Beji, in a statement yesterday said the governor had allegedly failed in governance and could not implement the newly approved minimum wage of N30,000 for workers. He said: “Governor Sani Bello, who has maintained that he didn’t promise anything during his campaigns, ought to know that the littlest of any government is the provision of security of lives and properties of citizens, failure of which he should either resign or be impeached. But any less is not acceptable. “The PDP frowns at these clear cases of misadventure that Governor Sani Bello is dragging the lives and properties of Nigerlites into, the insecurity occasioned by the failed and non-coherent security architecture in the state is enough.” You lied about IDB's $181m loan for Minna-Bida road dualization, Gov Bello replies ex-Gov Aliyu We’re re-strategising for governorship election – Niger PDP You lied about IDB’s $181 loan, Gov Bello replies ex-gov Aliyu
