A trailer killed a yet to be identified woman with her four-year -old daughter and a middle aged man near Himma filling station, in Gwagwalada, on Abuja-Lokoja road. A witness said the incident happened on Saturday morning around 9:23 am when a Daf trailer without registration number loaded with cows lost control and crushed the woman and daughter. He said the trailer, which was coming from Zuba axis tried to avoid hitting a Golf car, which made a u -turn abruptly in front of the trailer, when it lost control and the bucket pulled off and landed on the woman selling roasted yam by the roadside. Our reporter gathered that some miscreants who came from Anguwar Dodo with sticks, stones and clubs smashed some vehiclesâ€™ windscreen and also allegedly snatched handsets of some passersby at the accident scene.
