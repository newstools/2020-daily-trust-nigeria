In an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, the management of Kaduna Electric and Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) have  restricted electricity users in their franchise areas to digital payment channels and online complaint handling platforms. In a statement, the Head, Corporate Communication of Kaduna DisCo, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, said the advice became necessary in adherence to calls by medical experts on the need to contain the spread of the disease. He said the customers could use any of the online payment platforms from the comfort of their homes or offices to pay their electricity bills or purchase electricity token. He also advised electricity users who might have any complaint to use the company’s Customers Relationship Management (CRM) portal to lodge such complaint, assuring that the complaint shall be attended to with dispatch. “As a responsible corporate citizen, we are concerned about the safety of every Nigerian, hence, our decision to activate measures that will not only make the payment of bills convenient to our customers, but will also help curtail the spread of the virus,” Abdullahi said. Equally, Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) said it had taken measures to protect staff and customers from the deadly virus and that several measures had been taken to ensure that most of its services ran online in the interest of everyone. The Head, Corporate Communications of KEDCO, Ibrahim Sani Shawai, in a statement, said the online mode of payment was triggered by the need to ensure compliance with the social distancing tip advocated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Nigerian government.
