The Federal Capital Territory FCT Administration has convicted 20 people for violating the sit-at-home directive of President Muhammadu Buhari. The Minister of the FCT, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, on Wednesday, announced that five mobile courts would be reactivated to try violators of the lockdown. Chairman of the Lockdown Enforcement Team, Mr Ikharo Attah, stated this while giving an update on those convicted. He said they were fined between N1,000 and N5, 000, while those who had vehicles would only get them back after the lockdown has been lifted, with the likelihood of paying for demurrage. “We have at least five mobile courts and we are hoping to open more with the assistance of the Legal Unit of the Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS). “As of 1: 00 pm, we already secured 20 convictions, while two pleaded not guilty. We also arrested a man who is not a policeman but who was wearing a police face cap and he has been detained at the Police Station in Mpape. “We were on the Kubwa-Mpape road as early as 4am, but we are going to tighten our grip on these areas because when we locked down Mpape to traffic, we discovered that residents were sneaking out massively on foot to access Maitama’’, he said. He also said that the team would start arresting joggers from today. ‘‘We now have thousands of people coming out in some areas to jog, very early in the morning. We are going to arrest them”, he added. Lockdown: A fortress with fallen walls Coronavirus: Despite lockdown, social distancing fails in Lagos COVID-19: Experts back Buhari on lockdown extension
