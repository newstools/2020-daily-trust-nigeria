The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has expressed its worry over the upsurge in rape cases across the country. The body, therefore, urged President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Mrs Aisha Buhari, to mobilise all governors’ wives and female lawmakers and lead a protest against the crime. Addressing newsmen in Abeokuta yesterday, the NANS’ spokesman, Azeez Adeyemi, said, “we hereby call for an uncompromised investigation of these incidences of rape to determine the actual cause of its recent upsurge across the country. We call on our security agencies to be up and doing to unravel those behind these inhuman acts and bring them to book to serve as deterrent to others. Nigerians are restless to know those behind this wickedness. Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
