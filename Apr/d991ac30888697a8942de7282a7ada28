Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello has distanced himself from campaign posters suggesting his interest in the presidency come 2023. A poster with the All Progressives Congress (APC) logo and colours attributing that ambition to him has been in circulation on the social media. The message on the poster says, ‘All Progressives Congress Continual of Good Governance. Vote for Governor Yahaya Bello as President, Federal Republic of Nigeria’. However, a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Onogwu Muhammed in Lokoja, said Bello has no prior knowledge of the purported materials neither does he have any link with the group or individuals behind them. ‘‘We want to state categorically that Governor Bello has no prior knowledge of that, neither the group nor the individuals behind the posters and flyers are known to his excellency,”he said.
