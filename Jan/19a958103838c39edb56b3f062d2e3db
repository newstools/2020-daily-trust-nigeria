The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Ogun State, Prof Abdulganiyu Raji, has warned against financial inducement ahead of Saturday’s House of Representatives rerun election in the state. The polls, which would hold in 13 polling units in Ijebu-Ode/Odogbolu/Ijebu North East Federal constituency, followed the Court of Appeal judgment nullifying elections in the affected area. Daily Trust reports that the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Korede Osunsanyan and that of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Taiwo Shote, would be battling for 10,635 votes in the rerun. Speaking in Ijebu-Ode on Wednesday at the stakeholders meeting, the REC hinted that the commission had incorporated the anti-graft agencies into the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) with a view to combating votes buying and selling during the election. He also disclosed that the commission had trained 100 ad hoc staff, who are members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) for the conduct of the polls. Raji reiterated INEC’s preparedness to conduct transparent and credible elections, calling on the political actors to adhere strictly to the electoral guidelines. In his address, Commissioner of Police Kenneth Ebrimson, who is the Chairman of ICCES, said the security agencies have mapped out new measures to curb votes’ inducement.  ...sacks Ogun APC Rep, validates Senator Odebiyi's election Tribunal nullifies Kashamu, six others’ election in Ogun Tribunal nullifies Kashamu, six other election results in Ogun
