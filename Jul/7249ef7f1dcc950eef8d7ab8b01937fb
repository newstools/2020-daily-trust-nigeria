A 40-year-old man, Edet Imoh, has confessed to the police in Lagos that he sexually assaulted his neighbour’s 11-year-old daughter “but only six times and not many times as her mother alleged”. The police arrested Imoh, a co-resident with the girl’s parents at Oyekanle Street, Bariga, in the Lagos metropolis, following a report by the girl’s mother at the Bariga police station on June 25, 2020. It was alleged that anytime the suspect wanted to make love to the girl, he would invite her into his one-room apartment on the pretext he wanted to send her on an errand. But the bubble was said to have burst when a neighbour, who reportedly saw Imoh leading the girl into his room, informed the minor’s mother when she was searching for her. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said yesterday,  “the suspect was caught with his boxers down while he lay on the little girl having sex with her. “When he was asked to explain what happened, the suspect said it was the devil’s handiwork. He said he had had sex with the girl only six times and not many times as the mother claimed.” Man remanded for allegedly defiling neighbour’s 3-yr-old daughter Man charged for raping neighbour’s deaf teenage daughter Security guard defiles seven-year-old girl
