The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has announced the sack of all directors on its payroll who had served for eight years and above as part of its ongoing manpower restructuring initiatives. The notice of sack was contained in a memo dated March 24, 2020, titled: “Notification,” signed by the FIRS Executive Chairman, Muhammad Nami, which was obtained by our correspondent. The new helmsman, who has embarked on a strategic redeployment of principal officers in the Service since his assumption of office barely three months ago, stated that the sack of the affected officers was in line with Para 10.1 (a)(iii) of HRPP. He further disclosed that the revenue agency’s board had given approval for the appointment of four coordinating directors in acting capacity and two group leads, all for only a single term of six months. Although, the executive chairman did not mention the names of the sacked directors in the memo, he, however, listed the names of the coordinating directors who will function in acting capacity as including; Dr. Asheikh Maidugu, CD/Executive Chairman’s Group; Mr. Olufemi Oladeji Oluwaniyi, CD/Tax Operations Group; Mr. Innocent Chinyere Ohagwa, CD/General Services Group; and Mr. Ezra Usman Zubairu as CD/Enforcement Support Group.

While wishing the sacked top officers of the service well in their future endeavours, Nami congratulated the newly promoted staff and advised them to continue to work hard and support the management in its current drive to meet and surpass the agency’s revenue targets.
