No fewer than 3,475 widows were among other beneficiaries who received stimulus packages to cushion the effect of the lockdown in Ijebu-North Local Government, Ogun State. A former Chairman of the local government, Asiwaju Tele Ogunjobi, who donated the packages yesterday, said the distribution of the packages, which involved food items and cash, was targeted at the aged, widows and the vulnerable in the society. Ogunjobi said the distribution, channelled through the leader of the Ago Iwoye Central Development Council (ACDC), Mr Anthony Daniel, was held at 8 Quarters in the university community of Ago Iwoye, Oru-Owa and Ilaporu in Ijebu North II constituency of Ogun State. He appealed to the people of the community to adhere strictly to the movement restriction order issued by the government, stressing that it was in their best interest. Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, the head of the Imere community, Chief Joshua Ademosu, expressed appreciation to Ogunjobi for deeming it fit to cater for the less-privileged at a period things were hard for citizens. Ademosu, therefore, called on other well-to-do people in the society to emulate Ogunjobi so that the indigent would also live a good life.
