One of the confirmed positive cases of Coronavirus in Bauchi State has rejected the isolation centre at Bauchi Specialist hospital and return home. A reliable source at the hospital told Daily Trust Saturday that the patient who is an important personality and a friend to the state governor rejected the isolation centre and returned home due to the filthy condition of the centre, saying “This place is too dirty I can’t stay here.” The source explained that 62-year-old left the hospital for his home in GRA despite appeals from medical personnel at the centre. Another source at the ministry of health confirmed the incident and said that the taskforce committee on the Coronavirus held a meeting and decided to relocate to another isolation centre at Abubakar Tafawa University Teaching Hospital (Sani Same ward) which is more convenient for him. “He has agreed to return to the ATBU teaching hospital and right now an ambulance has been sent to his house to convey him back to the isolation centre,” the source said. Commenting on the case during the daily briefings on Coronavirus in the state, state Commissioner of Health Dr Aliyu Muhammed Maigoro, did not deny the incident, but said, “The second index is currently admitted in the hospital.” FG confirms new coronavirus case in Nigeria COVID-19: 'Bauchi governor's test result to be out in 24 hours' COVID-19 exposure: Many govs refuse to self-isolate
