The Managing Director of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Mr Usman Gur Mohammed on Tuesday barred the General Manager, Special Duties, Engr. Chris Okonkwo, from office over alleged lapse of his appointment for over two years. The letter dated 24th April 2020 stated: “After servicing TCN for a period of about six years, please be informed that your political posting had lapsed by 11th June 2018, and you have ceased from coming to work from 12th June 2018. Consequently, you are to stop coming to work with immediate effect.” The letter of appointment of Okonkwo, who is the national president of the Senior Staff Association of Electricity and Allied Companies (SSAEAC), shows that the former Minister of Power, Prof. Chinedu Nebo, had on 2nd June 2014, posted Okonkwo as General Manager, Market Operations to TCN. He was among the disengaged staff of the defunct PHCN after the power sector privatisation.

He stated: “My appointment was in the line of my competence and contributions in the defunct PHCN. “My letter of Appointment/Promotion being in furtherance of my service, did not carry term or tenure of service since subject to Civil/Public Service Rule of 60 years age or 35 years length of service bar,” Okonkwo maintained. Reacting to the management’s decision in a joint statement, the TCN branches of SSAEAC and the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) lauded the management for not extending the appointment of the General Manager.
