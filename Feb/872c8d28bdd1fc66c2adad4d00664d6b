The Federal Ministry of Power said it has strengthened its reforms and warned its officials against poor service delivery to end-users. The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mrs. Didi Walson-Jack, disclosed this during a sensitisation programme for officers on Grade Level four to 17 in Abuja. Mrs. Walson-Jack said the ministry created the Department of Reform Coordination and Service Improvement (RCSI) in 2015 to promote the culture of excellent service delivery. She charged the officers to observe the role of Service Compatibility (SERVICOM) which has a ground rule of “serve others the way you want to be served” in all their service delivery efforts to support the stance of the Minister, Engr. Sale Mamman, on efficient service delivery. The National Coordinator of SERVICOM at the presidency, Nnenna Akajemeli, in a presentation, said Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) should have a service charter, which is a written statement of commitment of an organisation to provide to its customers quality service. Akajemeli charged the officers to ethically adhere to the provisions of the charter and do what was needful at their various offices to uphold public trust. The Director of RCSI, Nwachukwu Bernard, also charged the officers to always adhere to their rules of engagement. Citing the instance of the teacher recently rewarded by Gov. Zulum of Borno State for her dedication to duty, he said great rewards awaited anybody who was dedicated to duty because “you may not know who is observing.” SERVICOM charges environment  ministry Kano pays N37m gratuity to contract staff FG to adopt e-mgt system to promote transparency
