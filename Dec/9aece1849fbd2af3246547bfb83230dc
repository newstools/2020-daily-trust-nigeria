The leadership of the People’s Redemption Party (PRP) has named its national secretariat after Alhaji Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa. Alhaji Musa, who was the party’s national leader and Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT), died on November 11, 2020 aged 84. The Interim National chairman of the party, Professor Sule Bello, while speaking at the 40th day prayer for the late BoT chairman, yesterday in Kaduna, said his loss had created a vacuum which would be very difficult to fill. He, however,  assured that PRP would continue on its progressive path, saying “We are presently continuing with preparations to realign and reposition the party from the ward to national level.”  The leadership of the People’s Redemption Party (PRP) has named its national secretariat after Alhaji Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa.
