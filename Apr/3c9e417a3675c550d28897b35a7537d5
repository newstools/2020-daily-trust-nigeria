In his condolence letter to Wamakko, Tinubu said: “Please accept my deepest sympathy and condolences over the passing on Monday of your younger brother, Alhaji Buba Dangaladima Wamakko, who died at 66, after an illness. “Losing a close relation like a brother can be painful and agonising. I wish I could find adequate words to comfort you, my brother. “As Muslims, we must accept his demise as the will of Allah. We must remain grateful to Allah that within the period he lived, he distinguished himself and made his impact felt.” Buhari mourns Wamakko’s brother Honourable Abdullahi Wamakko: Death yet in the household DPP’s divisive politics in Sokoto
