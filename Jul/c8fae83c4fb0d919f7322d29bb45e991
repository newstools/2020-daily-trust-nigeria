Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Ondo State Command, have deployed 1,725 personnel to beef up security before, during and after the Eid-el-Kabir celebration. The NSCDC Commandant in the state, Philip Ayuba, said the Command had strategically deployed both uniformed and undercover personnel to the 18 local government areas of the state to provide adequate security for lives and properties, safeguard critical national assets, gather intelligence and manage disaster. Ayuba assured the state of a peaceful Eid-el-Kabir celebration and appealed to the public to avoid over-crowded gatherings and adhere strictly to hygienic precautionary protocols as stipulated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He said until there was a global cure for coronavirus, the hygienic practices of washing of hands regularly, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, wearing of nose/face mask and social distancing would remain a continuous practice. He, therefore, issued a stern warning to crime-minded individuals who might be planning to take advantage of the festivities to cause any disarray in the political, social, economic and religious activities of the state to desist from such a thought, as whoever was nabbed would face the wrath of the law. The Commandant charged the NSCDC operatives to act proactively to forestall all forms of nefarious activities across the state. He disclosed that in about 32 cases that the Command handled between January and now, there were six judgments of five convictions and acquittal. The cases, he said, ranged from conspiracy and tampering with telecommunication fittings, unlawful dealings in petroleum products, stealing of petroleum products, advanced fee fraud, child abuse, sexual defilement of minor and other related offences.
