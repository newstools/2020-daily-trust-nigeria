The Rotary Club of Abuja, Gudu, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has pledged to provide scholarship to about 200 indigent students and basic education materials to pupils within the district as part of its humanitarian services. The inaugural Charter President, Mrs. Ogechi Nwadoka, made the pledge at the weekend in Abuja during her installation, induction of charter members and fund-raising dinner. She also pledged the charter’s commitment to providing toilet facilities to schools within the district. According to her, the club believed that the projects, when implemented, would support the federal government’s efforts in returning out-of-school children to classrooms and meeting the target of ending open defecation in the country by 2025. Uwadoka said the club was looking at providing writing materials, school uniforms, school fees, sandals, bags or other materials that would motivate them to go to school. “While the target was 200 pupils, the number could be expanded with more funds. On the scholarship, we are targeting about N30,000 per pupil in basic level and about N80,000 for those in primary schools. “For now, we cannot go into secondary school because it will be heavier for us. You will also find out that the money we will use for one secondary school child can take care of about five primary school children,” she said. The president added that their visits to schools revealed that some of them have toilets but no water, while some didn’t have toilets at all. She said, “We have looked at it that for those who have toilet facilities, we will renovate. For those that lack access to water, we will provide water, such as boreholes. For those who don’t have toilet facilities at all, we are ready to provide.”  Rotary Club pledges support for schools Page 6 Monday August 17 964 students to enjoy toilet facility from Rotary
