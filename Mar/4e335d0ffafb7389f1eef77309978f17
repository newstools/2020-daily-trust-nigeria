Governors who are members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have expressed concern over the rising cases of coronavirus in the country. The governors, under the aegis of Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), called on Nigerians to stop wishing their leaders bad things, adding that unity among citizens at this period was paramount. Speaking through the Director-General of PGF, Salihu Lukman, the governors expressed displeasure at the state of health facilities in the country, urging both leaders and the led to join hand and ensure that they worked in harmony. “As a result, we are witnessing expressions of joy when our leaders are infected by COVID-19 virus. And our leaders are also not open to public suggestions and recommendations. It is virtually a case of establishing a negative equilibrium, which negates all possible engagements between our leaders and citizens on how best to respond to the policy challenge that COVID-19 poses to the nation. “Part of what could be the challenge facing us as Nigerians may be the issue of initiating processes of developing our health sector such that it is able to mobilise our leaders and citizens to work in harmony. “Unfortunately, because the reality of our national life has made citizens to distrust all our leaders at all levels, public conversations around these issues are cynical and full of anger. “In the circumstance, all that appear to dominate all our news platforms are negative commentaries and in some respect, doomsday analysis and projections. “With such reality, we may just be setting ourselves, as a nation, for a disaster. So long as our term of engagement with our leaders is informed by a negative mindset, the outcome would most likely only be negative,” he said.
