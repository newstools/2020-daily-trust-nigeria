Edo State government yesterday said the Chief Bisi Akande-led National Reconciliation Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) can end the crisis rocking the party across the country. This was contained in a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie and made available to journalists in Benin, the state capital. The feud between Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki and his predecessor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has created factions in the state chapter of the party. The state government commended President Muhammadu Buhari for putting together a committee of persons with proven integrity on the matter. “With the person of the renowned statesman and leader of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande, heading this committee, and other very worthy leaders of our party as members, we have no doubt that justice will not only be done but seen to be done in the execution of the mandate of this committee,” it stated. It restated the state government’s commitment to peace in the party in the state and across the country.
