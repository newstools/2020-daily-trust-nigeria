Concerned indigenes of Zamfara state have punctured the claims  that a former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari was no longer relevant in the politics of the state, following the dismissal of the APC review application by the Supreme Court. According to the group, the politicians were ignorant of Yari’s political relevance in the current scheme of things, and his fighting spirit for the next battle coming up ahead in  2023 general election. In a statement issued in Sokoto, the group insisted that the ex-Governor was still the leader of APC in the state, and a force to reckon with for the party to maintain its grip of the northwest beyond 2023. Secretary General of the group, Musa Gusau said the former governor should be commended for his quest to recover Zamfara at the apex court. After Koguna’s loss, what next for Yari in Zamfara?
