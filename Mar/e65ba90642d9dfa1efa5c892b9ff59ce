The Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) and the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT)  have suspended their planned strike which was slated for today (Tuesday) across the territory over nonpayment of civil servants and teachers minimum wage by the area council chairmen. The suspension of the strike was contained in a communiqué, which was issued at the end of a meeting between the two unions officials and the board chairman of FCT Area Council Service Commission (ACSC) Alhaji Isah Ramat Sa’idu and the six area council chairmen, in Abuja yesterday. It said the suspension of the strike was to ascertain the financial implication of the new minimum wage (2019) of the area councils and the Local Education Authorities (LEA) in two weeks, while all workers of the area councils and LEAs are encouraged to work hard. “In view of the above, the intended strike action billed for Tuesday 2nd March 2019, is here by suspended, as the minimum wage will be implemented by March 2020,”  the communiqué said. The communique was jointly signed by the board chairman of ACSC, NULGE and NUT.
