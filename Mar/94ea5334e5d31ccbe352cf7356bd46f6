The Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) yesterday said it has deployed more hands to ensure that members of the public comply with the state government’s directives on social distancing in its efforts at containing the coronavirus disease. To this end, the agency has directed all its personnel to remain at their duty posts to enforce compliance. According to the LAGESC Corps Marshal, retired Commissioner of Police, Gbemisola Akinpelu, “As the agency is part of the essential service providers and enforcement team of the Lagos State government, it has directed all operatives to remain at their duty posts to ensure that these directives are strictly adhered to towards ensuring the safety of lives against the coronavirus pandemic in the state.” Akinpelu implored all operators of non-food and non-medical stores/markets to close down their outlets, as directed by the state government, from March 26, 2020, adding that the agency, together with other enforcement and security personnel, would ensure strict compliance. She further admonished market leaders to scale up advocacy on the need to maintain environmental cleanliness in and around markets. She said the leaders should encourage personal hygiene among their members and other market users by telling them to engage in regular hand washing with soap and water, as well as regular use of hand sanitisers and face masks. Akinpelu also reiterated the need for all and sundry to adhere to the state government’s directive banning religious, social and other gatherings of more 20 persons. She stressed that LAGESC officers would continue regular enforcement and monitoring of the social distancing directive, and ensure strict compliance with other important health tips across the state.
