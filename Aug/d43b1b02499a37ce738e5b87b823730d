The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) on Wednesday opened bids for the prequalification of contractors for the 2020 capital projects. Daily Trust reports that over 700 bidders are jostling for the 2020 capital projects of the corporation. Managing Director of NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, who spoke at the event held at the NRC headquarters in Lagos assured that the corporation would ensure due process and transparency in the process. Okhiria, who was represented by the NRC Director of Operations, Mr. Niyi Alli, noted that though the COVID-19 pandemic had delayed the process, the management would expedite actions on the NRC’s goal in the budget year. Daily Trust reports that the bidders were however absent at the bid opening but the process was transmitted to them in keeping with the COVID-19 social distancing protocol. The NRC also invited independent observers comprising two nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and representatives of the Nigerian Society of Engineer (NSE). The MD said: “We had to come up with an ingenious way of ensuring that the process is being completed and we are trying to make sure that it is transparent as required by the laws of the land. “We have categories of work we want to do, we have things like maintenance of our locomotives, procurements of spare parts and others to ensure we provide quality service for Nigerians,” he added.
