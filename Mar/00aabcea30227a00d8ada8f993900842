The Chairman of Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State Governor, Dr John Kayode Fayemi, has said the country needs more than governance for the goodwill of the people. Fayemi stated this when the Czeck Ambassador to Nigeria, Marek Skolil, called on him at his Abuja residence, a statement issued by NGF’s Head of Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazaque Bello, stated. “In the minds of the people, we need more than governance for the goodwill of the people.  At the end of the day, there are no federal Nigerians but state citizens. So, those who are friends of Nigeria must understand the two level strata of our government and aid the one that best touches the heart of the problem as it were. “We’ve proved that we are not just a democracy that writes election results and the country is gradually emerging strong among regions where one must prove his mettle to win, by propounding a strong manifesto and agenda for the people and genuinely convincing them that one is there for their general good. There is no democracy without rule of law,” he said. Earlier, the ambassador who was accompanied by his embassy’s Political Secretary, Maria Nwanyanwu, who came decked in Ankara to buttress her links with Nigeria, was happy about the prospects of helping Nigeria in any way he and his government could.
