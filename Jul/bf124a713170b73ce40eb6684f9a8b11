Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has said he was inspired by the video of a young boy online asking his mother to ‘calm down’ as she was set to punish him for a misdemeanour, with the governor taking to his facebook account to encourage residents of the state to assume the same disposition while celebrating Eid-el-Kabir. “I was moved by his sobriety, which reflected in his promise of ‘last chance’, when confronted with the fact that he is a regular offender. I will like to meet the young boy since we both now have exclusive rights to the phrasal verb ‘calm down,” he said. The governor said he found the exchange funny, but realised it depicted the efforts parents put into moulding children into responsible adults. He said, “I want to assume that his mother, indeed, calmed down because the appeal was moving enough to make anyone change their mind. Interestingly, the video inspired this special message to the good people of Lagos State because of the deeper meaning it conveys. “I urge every Lagosian to calm down and not get carried away by the excitement of the moment. Like the rest of the world, we are still in the middle of a pandemic and need to remain extremely careful to keep the gains of the sacrifices we have all made in the past months.” Sanwo-Olu names Onikan Stadium after late Mobolaji Johnson Only the best will get appointed into my cabinet - Sanwo-Olu Sanwo-Olu signs N1.168trillion 2020 budget, promises over 90 % implementation
