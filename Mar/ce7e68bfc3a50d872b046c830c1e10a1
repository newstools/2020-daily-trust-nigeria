The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Wednesday announced the sack of all directors on its payroll who had served for eight years and above as part of its ongoing manpower restructuring initiatives. The notice of the sack was contained in a memo dated March 24, 2020, titled: “Notification,” signed by the FIRS Executive Chairman, Muhammad Nami, which was obtained by our correspondent. The new helmsman, who has embarked on a strategic redeployment of principal officers in the Service since his assumption of office barely three months ago, stated that the sack of the affected officers was in line with Para 10.1 (a)(iii) of HRPP. He further disclosed that the revenue agency’s Board had given approval for the appointment of four Coordinating Directors in Acting capacity and two Group Leads, all for only a single term of six months. Although the Executive Chairman did not mention the names of the sacked Directors in the memo, he, however, listed the names of the Coordinating Directors who will function in Acting Capacity as including Dr. Asheikh Maidugu CD/Executive Chairman’s Group; Mr. Olufemi Oladeji Oluwaniyi CD/Tax Operations Group; Mr. Innocent Chinyere Ohagwa CD/General Services Group; and Mr. Ezra Usman Zubairu CD/Enforcement Support Group. Those appointed as Group Leads are Mrs. Faosat Ogunniyi, Compliance Support Group; and Ms. Chiaka Okoye, Digital Support Group. While wishing the sacked top officers of the Service well in their future endeavours, Nami congratulated the newly promoted staff and advised them to continue to work hard and support the management in its current drives to meet and surpass agency’s revenue targets.
