The kidnapped duo of Olori Funbi, wife of the Baba Aso of Igbole in Ogbo-Ora, Oba Olusanjo Ojo, and her daughter have regained freedom after payment of a N2.5 million ransom. The two persons were released on Wednesday evening by their abductors and dropped in a bush along the Igboora-Abeokuta road. Olori Funbi is the Matron of the Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology (OYSCATECH) Health Centre. It was gathered that the monarch’s wife and her daughter were kidnapped on Monday evening when they were returning from the College. The kidnappers had on Tuesday evening via a phone call demanded N4m ransom for their victims to be released. A family source confirmed to reporters on Thursday via telephone that the two persons regained freedom after payment of the sum of N2.5m delivered to the kidnappers in a bush somewhere on the Igboora-Abeokuta road. “Olori and her daughter have been released yesterday night after the payment of N2.5m. We took the money to the abductors yesterday night to get them back. “We delivered the money in a bush, surrounded by about 12 armed herdsmen. They told us that not even policemen can stop them. It is a pity that security in this country has become a great mess. “It has got to the extent that these people now operate undisturbed. I think our people should evolve measures to stop this mess if police can’t stop the kidnappers from this dastardly act,” he said. No fewer than 10 of such kidnap cases have occurred in the Igboora axis within the last two years. The Oyo State Police Public Relations Officer, Gbenga Fadeyi, confirmed that the monarch’s wife and daughter had regained freedom. “I can confirm to you that the abducted wife of the monarch and her daughter have been released unhurt,” Fadeyi said.
