The Nasarawa State House of Assembly has suspended its legislative activities for the next two weeks to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease in the country. Speaker Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi, who disclosed this yesterday, said the House would continue partnering with the executive arm to tackle the spread of the disease in the state and the country at large. He, however, said the parliament would recall when necessary, adding that they would continue to monitor situations regarding COVID-19 pandemic. “We are committed to the welfare of our people; we are committed to the health of our people as a healthy nation is a wealthy nation. Security agents should also remain at their duties posts to take control of the House,” he said. He, however, directed the management staff, particularly directors, to come to work.
