Senate President Ahmad Lawan has constituted a 56-member constitution review committee chaired by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege. The committee is composed of all the eight principal officers, one senator each from the 36 states and two members from each of the six geo-political zones. Members of the committee, including the principal officers who will also serve as the steering committee, are Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi; Deputy Senate Leader, Senator Ajayi Borrofice; Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Sabi Abdullahi; Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Senate Deputy Minority Leader, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha; Minority Whip, Senator Philip Aduda and Deputy Minority Whip, Senator Sahabi Ya’u. The six geo-political zones are represented by: North West, Senators Bala Ibn’Nallah and Ibrahim Shekarau; North East,  Senators Kashim Shettima and Lawal Yahaya Gumau; North Central, Senators Umar Tanko Al-Makura and Yakubu Oseni; South West, Abdulfatah Buhari and Biodun Olujimi; South East, Lillian Ekwunife and Chukwuka Utazi; South-South, Senator Rose Oko and Senator Eyakenyi Akon Etim. Lawan noted that every state was represented in the committee to reflect the yearnings of all Nigerians. He, however, said senators who are not members of the committee could still participate by way of giving submissions and advice they feel strongly about for the committee to succeed. He said the committee would engage not only members of the National Assembly and other statutory bodies like INEC and civil society groups but also Nigerians. He urged members of the committee to open up to public opinions, expert advice and civil society organisations in order to produce a credible and acceptable constitution that works for Nigerians.
