The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) has asked the federal government to ensure the safety and well-being of Nigerian workers by providing them with the necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and tools that will enhance in the performance of their noble work.  The PRP in a statement yesterday by its National Chairman, Mallam Falalu Bello to mark this year’s May Day, said the government should do this through prompt payment of hazard allowance as announced by President Muhammadu Buhari  in his recent speech on COVID-19 pandemic. “Nigerian workers and their leaders must appreciate the historic limitations of economic struggles and trade union action for just workers’ welfare and combine their efforts with the struggle for political power which ultimately shapes the condition under which workers work and live,” the party stated.
