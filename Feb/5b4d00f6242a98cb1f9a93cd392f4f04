A consortium of A. J. Walters/Glovesly/Egypt Air has been shortlisted to bid for Nigeria’s Aviation Leasing Company (ALC). For the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility, two companies – A.J. Walters/Glovesly/Egypt Air and Ethiopian Airlines – were shortlisted out of seven that expressed interest for the facility. The ALC, when established, will be responsible for acquiring new and sometimes used aircraft and leased same to local airlines, especially the national carrier when it finally comes into fruition. The MRO will be a facility to fix aircraft due for maintenance and other routine checks rather fly them abroad. Both companies, if established, will save Nigerian millions of dollars annually, monies that would have gone to foreign companies when Nigeria registered aircraft access these facilities abroad. According to the Director Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, James Oduadu, stated that the companies were shortlisted during the bidders’ conferences for the two major components of the aviation sector roadmap. In attendance were officials of the Ministry of Aviation, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), Federal Ministry of Finance, Aviation Labour Unions, Transaction Advisers and prospective investors, Odaudu added. Declaring the Conferences open, the Director, Planning, Research and Statistics and Chairman of the Project Delivery Team, Alhaji Muhammad Shehu said the event marked another phase of the government’s determination to ensure the realization of the projects. He also assured of a transparent process leading to the actualization of the projects which are being executed through public private Partnerships.
