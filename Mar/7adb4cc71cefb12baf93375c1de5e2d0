A group known as Concerned Citizens of Zamfara State has urged the Supreme Court to ignore the alleged antics of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) aimed at influencing its judgement on the appeal seeking a review of its earlier ruling on the governorship election in the state. It would be recalled that the apex court had upheld the judgement of the lower court which sacked all elected officers of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. In a statement signed by its Secretary, Musa Gusau, the group described as childish the claim by the PDP that the opposition APC was behind the reservation of judgement on the matter by the apex court. “This is a fabricated lie and uncalled for. PDP is becoming a house of irrational thought,” it said. “Why is the PDP desperate on this case which is an APC family affair? In the case before the apex court, there is nowhere the PDP is mentioned as a defendant or a party to the dispute. So, why are they meddling into something that does not concern them; is it that they have lost faith as they came to power in Zamfara through the back door?,” the group asked. The stakeholders urged the court to also ignore the claim that the review of the judgement would trigger a breakdown of law and order in the state, saying Zamfara has never belonged to PDP.
