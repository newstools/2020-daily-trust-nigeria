The National Association of Nigeria Traditional Medicine Practitioners  (NANTMP) has thrown its weight behind the  Federal Government’s measures put in place to curb  the spread  of Coronavirus pandemic in the country. The association’s President Shaba Maikudi Sani, said the  stay-at home order, cancelation   of all international flights and closure of land boarders would control the rapid spread of  the disease. Sani stated this while  meeting with the union’s  board of trustees headed by Alh. Dr. Adamu Shehu Bashiru. A statement issued by  Dr. Godwin Nyitse, Senior Special Assistant  Media and Publicity to Sani, said the leadership of the association is fully in support of President Muhammadu Buhari’s decisions on the fight against the COVID-19. The practitioners also urged the government to collaborate with them in containing the pandemic. “NANTMP  has equally upgraded its Traditional Medicine Centre for Disease Control (TMCDC) and we have also setup a research committee made up of highly experienced traditional medicine practitioners with over 40 years of  experience to carryout a well -coordinated research for the cure and eradication of the coronavirus in Nigeria has said.
