The chairman and chief executive of Stonehedge Hotels, Alhaji Hassan Ahmad Danbaba, said his company is delighted with the opening of the hotel in Kaduna, which he said is a dynamic and one of Nigeria’s booming cities. He said the company is a premium brand that specializes in delivering supreme hospitality. He added that Kaduna state Governor Nasiru El-Rufai will officially unveil the hotel on Monday in a grand ceremony featuring business tycoons and captains of industries. Governors of Kano, Jigawa, Gombe, Edo, Nasarawa, among others are expected to accompany the Kaduna Governor during the occasion. It noted that the hotel features 32 spacious sophisticated and contemporary guest rooms with plush beddings; with a unique culinary indulgence domiciled inside its 140-seater restaurant that serve both local and foreign inspired cuisine; as well as extensive business and leisure facilities. “This is one of our modest contribution to the tourism sector in Kaduna. With this, we are also complementing Governor Nasiru El-Rufai’s urban renewal effort of the defunct headquarters of Northern Nigeria. “We’ve seen the sporadic growth of Kaduna’s GDP in the last five years of Governor El-Rufai’s administration, and we are determined to contribute our quota towards job creation and excellent service delivery to the people of Kaduna state,” the Stonehedge chairman said. ‘Multiple taxation is crippling hospitality business’ Despite insurgency, North remains a good entrepreneurial hub  -Top Galaxy Hotel Chairman Controversy rages as Kaduna Durbar hotel goes down
