Value Added Tax (VAT) increased by 27% at the Customs Level and 13% at the Non-Import Level. The statement further noted that the passage of the Finance Act 2019 led to a drop in Withholding Tax rate from 5% to 2.5% in some sectors. The Act, according to the statement, also tinkered with Pre-operational levy (levy paid by taxpayers to obtain TCC) thereby resulting in a 5% collection in Q1, 2020, a drop from 7% in Q1, 2019. “With the full take-over of PAYE and PIT in the FCT by FCT-IRS, the FIRS lost all FCT collection, which led to the fall in both Pay As You Earned (PAYE) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) for Q1, 2020”, it said. The statement further disclosed that performance was a direct result of the blockage of leakages and other wide-ranging reforms launched by the Executive Chairman of the service, Muhammad Nami, towards repositioning the Service for efficient service delivery.
