The Yoruba people have been urged to come out in their large numbers on Tuesday January 21, 2020 to participate in a protest rally in support of Operation Amotekun, the security network governors in the South- west established to wage war against insecurity in the zone. The protest, code-named “Amotekun Solidarity Walk” is being organized by Yoruba World Congress (YWC); an umbrella body of all Yoruba Socio-cultural and Self Determination Groups within and beyond Nigeria, will take place in all the South West States capital. The YWC is led by Yoruba leader, an emeritus professor of History and second republic senator, Banji Akintoye. According to a statement made available to newsmen on Saturday by the YWC Director of Contacts and Mobilization, Comrade Victor Taiwo,  the protest will hold simultaneously in Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, Osogbo, Akure and Ado-Ekiti simultaneously, from 9am. The statement said, “All Yoruba people are urged to come out in their millions anywhere they are in Oduduwa land on Tuesday to show to the world that Amotekun has come to stay. “Well-meaning Yoruba people and leaders of thought will be at designated venues to address the protest. We want to assure our governors that Yoruba people are behind them on Amotekun. We urge them not to shiver and they must never shiver. It is no retreat, no surrender. We will not surrender Amotekun.” Operation Amotekun: Yoruba World Congress holds Solidarity Walk Tuesday Amotekun: Inside South-West security outfit Details scanty as ‘Operation Amotekun’ starts in S/West
