The leadership of the Arewa Youth Assembly (AYA) has urged the House of Representatives to expedite action on the passage of the National Innovation Agency (Establishment Bill 2020) in view of its importance to national development. The Speaker of AYA, Mohammed Danlami, while commending the National Assembly on the first reading of the bill sponsored by Rep. Chris Azubogu, charged the legislature to prioritise the bill in its actions with a view to tapping its potential for national development. According to him, “the National Innovation Agency being proposed will play a leading role in the development of Nigeria’s innovation ecosystem by coordinating, networking, fostering and partnering different organisations from various fields such as academia, technology, industry, finance and investment. Its main focus will be on utilising knowledge management to achieve innovation, which could be employed as the principal tool in improving quality of life and as a driving tool for an increasingly competitive economy.”  Buratai declares Research and Innovation summit an annual event Can NSC get legal backing under Bio?
