The President of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Mrs. Toki Mabogunje has identified security of life and property as a critical factor in investment decisions. Mabogunje, in her address at the LCCI ‘Security Meet Business Dialogue’, which held in Lagos, described security of life and property as a major risk assessment variable for investment. According to her, business cannot thrive in an environment that is unsafe or perceived as insecure. She said: “After all, it is only the living that would do business.  Our country continues to contend with intractable security challenges bothering on insurgency attacks by boko haram terrorists, killings by armed banditry, herdsmen/farmers clashes, religious and ethnic crisis, kidnapping for ransom, armed robbery and cultism among others.” “These security challenges are widespread and experienced in practically all geopolitical zones and regions in the country and the impact on economic activities has been negative and profound.” Mabogunje lamented. While acknowledging  the efforts of the federal government at ensuring adequate security for all and sundry, she noted that a lot more needed to be done. According to her, it is the Chamber’s duty as  a promoter of private enterprise, to  continue to adopt innovative ways to address legacy and emerging security issues. “Security  Meets Business” is a platform for discussions and exchange of ideas between the private sector, diplomatic corps and the security agencies on the security situation in Nigeria. The LCCI boss said it was specifically designed to deliberate on how stakeholders can collaborate to ensure a safe and secured environment and also an opportunity for the security community to assure the business community of its commitment to the security of lives and property.
