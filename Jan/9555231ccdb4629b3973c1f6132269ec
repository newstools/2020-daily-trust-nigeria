Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has pledged to conduct local government elections in June this year to fulfil his campaign promises and strengthen democracy at the grassroots. The governor, who disclosed this while interacting with journalists after a victory rally over the Supreme Court judgment that validated his election, dedicated his victory to God and the people of the state. “In the next four to six months, Insha’Allah, we should be able to conduct local government elections so that the common man would have a choice. We are going to do it with minimal cost, not the way and manner it was done before, whereby it became the means of defrauding the people of the state. “We have already laid out our agenda for the state in terms of development and we have our executive council in place. Next week, we are going to organise a retreat with all our appointees and I want to assure you that we have been emboldened and we want to enshrine democracy,” Governor Mohammed said.
