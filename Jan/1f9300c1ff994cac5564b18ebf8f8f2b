The Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to caution the police top echelon to ensure that policemen deployed to monitor elections do not aid and abet rigging or manipulation of votes. In a statement yesterday by its executive director, Faith Nwadishi, the agency said it was necessary to caution the police to be neutral in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process. It said there were reported cases of police intimidation amidst violence in some states and procurement of court orders ostensibly to frustrate the electoral process in the January 25, 2020 re-run elections in the country. “For instance, in Akwa Ibom State, armed thugs invaded Ukana West, Ward 11, units 5, 8, 9 and Ikpe Annang Ward 5 unit 12 in Essien Udim LGA were electoral materials were carted away and INEC staff abducted. “The same thing happened in Abi LGA at Afafanyi/Igonigoni Ward where a Supervisory Presiding Officer was abducted along with electoral materials in commando-style through the Itigidi River thereby disrupting elections in 8 units of the ward. “In all these, the police looked the other way while hoodlums and desperate politicians had their way to the detriment of our democracy,” the CTA said.
