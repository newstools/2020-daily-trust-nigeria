MTN Nigeria has introduced ‘MTN Topit’, a new naming convention for its Virtual Top-Up (VTU) service, which allows customers to buy airtime as low as one naira and up to N3million. Topit provides an efficient means of recharge for data and airtime distribution across diverse forms of electronic recharge. With improved user experience, it mitigates any perceived price distortions and eliminates the irregularities associated with recharge PINs/Vouchers/and cards. It is also beneficial to retailers, trade partners and potential new partners as it provides ease of entry to start a recharge business, while saving costs of warehousing and inventory management. It is a step to eliminating the environment of paper pollution. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, MTN Nigeria, Adekunle Adebiyi described the new platform as part of the Company’s drive to make customers’ lives easier, brighter and better. He stated that Topit will help solve the problem of over-scratched card, misplaced or lost cards, long recharge codes to dial, too many codes to remember and environmental degradation. “With this new initiative, all barriers and restrictions are removed. It is a lot much better and improved than VTU. “We believe in a modern connected world, one in which our customers can get solutions at the snap of their fingers. This is what Topit delivers. We are excited at the amazing opportunities this platform offers our customers, retailers and trade partner”, Adebiyi added.
