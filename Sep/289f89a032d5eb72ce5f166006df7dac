Reconstruction of the historic 156-year-old market in Bida has been flagged off on Saturday after a fire that destroyed shops and other structures over a year ago. The multimillion-naira project was part of a zonal intervention project sponsored by the House of Representatives member representing Bida/Gbako/Katcha federal constituency of Niger State, Sa’idu Musa Abdul. The reconstruction was flagged off by the Nupe apex ruler, Etsu Nupe, Yahaya Abubakar. A modern structure of lock up shops will be constructed to replace the structures destroyed during the fire incidence which will be allocated to the traders affected by the incidence. The market was initiated during the reign of Etsu Masaba in 1864. It was gutted by a fire in 2018 which destroyed many shops leading to the loss of properties worth millions of naira.
