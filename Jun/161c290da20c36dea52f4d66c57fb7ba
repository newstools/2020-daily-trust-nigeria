Maigida said every attempt to get her to stop pounding on his ceiling failed. In addition, Maigida alleged that the defendant threatened him with a knife when he tried to talk to her to stop hitting objects on his ceiling. The pilot is praying the court to invoke the provisions of Sections 183 and 397 of the Penal Code. The defendant, however, denied the allegation and the court ordered police investigation and directed that a report be presented at the end of the investigation.
