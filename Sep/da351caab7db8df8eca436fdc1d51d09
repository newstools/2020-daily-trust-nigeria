CMA CGM, French container transportation and shipping company, has suspended the introduction of the controversial Peak Season Surcharge on each Cargo coming into the country. The suspension is coming barely one week after Maerskline said it has suspended the Peak Season Surcharge as a result of a planned protest by the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) and Organised Private Sector. Six foreign shipping companies had initiated a peak period hike, raising charges which normally should be about $200 per container, to about $1000 and above, drawing the NSC and stakeholders reactions recently.
