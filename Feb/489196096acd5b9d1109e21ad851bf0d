The FCT Department of Public Health has reiterated that there is no confirmed case of Coronavirus in the territory and advised residents to remain calm. According to a statement by Anthony Ogunleye, the Chief Press Secretary to the FCT Minister,  the Director of Public Health, Dr Josephine Okechukwu, confirmed this following the arrest and parade by the police of alleged pranksters who went to the Wuse District Hospital claiming that one of them had been infected by the Coronavirus. City News learnt that the action created panic and confusion  and disrupted health service delivery at the hospital. Dr Okechukwu said the FCT, and indeed the country, was free of the virus. She said that if such false information was released on the social media, it would do great damage not just to the FCT but the country at large. While parading the suspects at the Wuse Zone 3 Divisional Police Station, the FCT Force PRO DSP Anjuguri Manzah  said  the suspects, Peggy Shande (M), Abayomi Adedoyin (M), David Gold Enemigin (M) Priscilla Ajesola (F) and Jacob Oji  (M) claimed to be playing out a script about the virus without the knowledge or authorization of the relevant authorities of the FCTA.  5 arrested for coronavirus infection rumour Averting coronavirus epidemic in Nigeria city 1
