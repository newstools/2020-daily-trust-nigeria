The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Borno is “highly impressed” with Governor Babagana Umara Zulum’s handling of security and general performance, factional chairman of the party, Usman Badeiri has said. Badeiri in a statement described as “unusual in less than one year”, governor Zulum’s performance. The governor is of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He however said himself and the state, local and ward executives he leads have no plan to ever leave the PDP. The PDP in Borno State has been sharply divided between two factions, one led by Badeiri who has been in the party since inception and the other faction led by Alhaji Zanna Gaddama who defected from the APC to PDP ahead of 2015 election. Badeiri, who leads what he calls “authentic members of the PDP in Borno State” with executives at the state, local government and ward  levels, said that the opposition party felt compelled to set aside party difference and give honour to whom it is due. “It took us 8 months to come to terms with what we consider an obligatory need for us to speak about the kind of Governor Borno is very lucky to have. The PDP in Borno acknowledges, that Governor Zulum has been extremely supportive of the fight against Boko Haram, by not only providing the necessary tools to the established armed forces, but to equally critical volunteers. “ Zulum has regularly been on humanitarian and developmental tour of most of Borno’s communities across the 27 local government areas, including tough and high risk terrains, ” he said.
