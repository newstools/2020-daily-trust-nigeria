Shortage of gas has hit at least 16 power generating plants causing power generation at its highest point to drop to 3,922 megawatts (MW) on Saturday. Operators said the drop would continue for another 10 days (since Friday) until scheduled maintenance was completed on the gas pipelines. Daily power generation statistics obtained by Daily Trust from the Independent System Operator (ISO), a section of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), puts peak generation at 4,055MW on Friday, but dropped to 3,922MW at the close of that day. By Saturday, the peak generation had dropped to 3,675MW. The highest power generation recorded on Sunday was 3,660MW, falling off the 4,000MW threshold recorded on Friday. In a statement, TCN’s spokesperson, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, confirmed this and noted that, “The nation’s power sector is experiencing power supply shortage caused by low gas supply which has restrained the ability of many thermal power stations to generate optimally.” Mrs. Mbah said four Generation Companies (GenCos) generated zero megawatts (MW) on Friday due to the cut in gas supply. The GenCos are Sapele NIPP, Olorunsogo NIPP, Ihovbor NIPP and Azura Edo. Twelve other GenCos were affected but generated at lower capacities. They are Egbin, Sapele, Delta (gas), Geregu, Omotosho, Olorunsogo, Geregu NIPP, Alaoji NIPP, Omotosho NIPP, Odukpani NIPP, Okpai and Omoku. TCN said the gas constraint had caused significant reduction in the quantum of power transmitted to the various Distribution Companies (DisCos) for supply to electricity consumers. The power evacuation company said management of some of the affected GenCos blamed the gas shortage, which was projected to last for about 10 days, on maintenance of gas pipelines.
