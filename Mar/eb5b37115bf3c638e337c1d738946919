Senator Kabiru Marafa’s faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has called on Governor Bello Matawalle to dump his party for theirs. Speaking to Daily Trust shortly after their meeting in Tsafe Local Government Area, the Commissioner for Rural Development, Alhaji Abdullahi Abubakar Tsafe, said their decision was premised on the governor’s effort to restore peace in the state. Tsafe is one of the appointees of the governor who are members of the APC in the state. The governor, who is of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had appointed members of the APC under what he tagged an “all-inclusive government.” The commissioner said they have noticed the governor’s outstanding leadership qualities which led to the restoration of peace, a feat, he said, Governor Matawalle’s predecessor could not achieve in eight years as the executive governor of the state. He further explained that Zamfara stands to reap a lot of benefits from the federal government because there is mutual respect between Governor Matawalle and President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that his defection would come with a lot of advantages especially in terms attracting federal government’s projects.
