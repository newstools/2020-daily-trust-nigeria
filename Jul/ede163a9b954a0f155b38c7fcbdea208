An angry mob set a suspected motorcycle thief ablaze at the Tipper Garage by SDP Junction in Gwagwalada, Abuja. A witness, Jamilu, said the incident happened last Friday around 04:00pm when two suspected motorcycle thieves attempted to steal a bike in the area. Jamilu said the thieves attempted to carry out the act when people were in the mosque to observe prayers. “In fact, it was one of the shop owners close to the mosque that saw them struggling to move the motorcycle away and raised an alarm,” he said. He further said one of the suspects narrowly escaped while the second was arrested by a mob that brought fuel and set fire on him. Our reporter learnt that the burnt remains of the suspect were later evacuated by the police. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT Police Command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, urged members of the public to desist from jungle justice, saying they should always report incidents of crime to the police.
