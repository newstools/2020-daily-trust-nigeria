A financial expert, Dr Samuel Nzekwe, on Tuesday called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to provide more loans to the nation’s  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the new year in order to promote sustainable development. Nzekwe, a former President of Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota that such loans would drive sustainable development in the country. According to him, no nation can achieve meaningful and sustainable development without creating an enabling environment for SMEs to thrive as catalysts of economic growth. “The cost of borrowing for SMEs and others in the productive sector  has been very high as banks do not have sufficient funds to give to investors. “The CBN needs to create more attractive loans for SMEs and the productive sector to contribute immensely to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP),” he said. The  financial expert  said that it had been  difficult for Nigeria’s SMEs to access loanable funds from the CBN, adding that in spite of  the apex bank’s intervention, SMEs were still finding it difficult to access loans.
