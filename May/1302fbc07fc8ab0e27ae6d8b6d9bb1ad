Turkey is to impose its first nationwide lockdown before Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The four-day lockdown is to start on Saturday, on the eve of Eid festivities, across all 81 provinces, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. Turkey has not had a stringent countrywide curfew since it reported its first positive case on March 11, resorting instead to weekend curfews in certain provinces. Erdogan said that some mosques would also gradually reopen for afternoon worship after Friday prayers on May 29.
