Traders and hawkers around Ahmadu Bello Way and other business areas in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State have been chased away by police and civil defence officers for flouting state government’s safety directive. Daily Trust reports that on Tuesday evening, Governor Simon Bako Lalong, while addressing citizens in a broadcast directed closure of all market areas with immediate effect except those selling food items. But hundreds of shop owners and hawkers around Ahmadu Bello Way and terminus were seen early morning of Wednesday going about their normal business despite the earlier directive. Contacted on the development, the Spokesperson of the state police Command, ASP Ubah Gabriel, said the action of the officers “is in line with the directive of the governor”, adding that the enforcement was supposed to commence today (Wednesday). Our correspondent reports that many shops were later closed down and hawkers have fled the area following the enforcement of the directive.
