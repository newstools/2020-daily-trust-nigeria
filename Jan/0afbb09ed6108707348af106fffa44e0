The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged Nigerians to expect more dividends of democracy in the 2020 New Year. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, who said yesterday that ruling party acknowledged and held dear the trust and faith Nigerians had placed in its government, promised not to let Nigerians down. Issa-Onilu urged Nigerians to play their part by cooperating with the government to achieve its development plans for shared progress. The party assured all that the faithful execution of policies and programmes of the current administration would be further intensified in this New Year. He said, “With our country’s landmark return to the January-December budget cycle – a feat achieved by the APC-led National Assembly and Executive after 16 years of the PDP failure, Nigerians are assured that the ongoing massive infrastructural development covering the rail, road, agriculture, aviation, port, education and health sectors would be given further fillip. “The President Muhammadu Buhari government is vigorously tackling and solving the social, economic and security challenges our country faces one after the other. Government’s successes in plugging revenue leakages, checking violent extremism, oil sector reforms, anti-corruption, economic diversification, curbing waste, infrastructure development among other achievements are profound testament.” “To our teeming members and supporters, our great party remains a progressive, strong, formidable and popular political unit delivering pro-people policies and repositioning our country through our elected and appointed officials at federal, state and local government levels. “We urge our members to support and cooperate with the recently-constituted National Reconciliation Committee which is empowered to address grievances of party members and resolve existing conflicts, all with a view to fostering unity and oneness within the party across the country.” By Muideen Olaniyi Elect candidates that can pass integrity test - APC June 12: Buhari`s govt has corrected past injustices - APC June 12: Buhari’s govt has corrected past injustices — APC
