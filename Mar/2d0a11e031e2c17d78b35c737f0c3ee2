A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Gbolahan Yishawu, representing Eti-Osa constituency 02, has called on residents of the state, especially those of his constituency, to cultivate the habit of washing their hands with soap regularly. Yishawu urged the residents not to be scared by the presence of the coronavirus scourge in Lagos but to adhere strictly to preventive measures. The lawmaker, who is the Chairman, House Committee on Budget and Economic Planning, advised that the people should always cover their mouth and nose properly with handkerchief or a tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. He said, “As the ministry of health said, cough into your elbow if handkerchief is not available. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as cough and breathing difficulties. “From current evidence, it appears that death is a rare outcome and occurs mostly in patients with underlying illnesses,” he said. Yishawu also advised the residents against self-medication and report to the nearest health facility if they began experiencing any of the symptoms. “We must also ensure that we keep our surroundings clean to avoid this terminal disease called COVID-19”, he added.  3000 Eti-Osa constituents get free dental care Sympathisers besiege Tinubu’s house over son’s death Lagos lawmaker commissions borehole for Takwa Bay community
