Osun State House of Assembly yesterday suspended all parliamentary activities for 16 days as part of measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the state. The chairman, House Committee on Information, Hon. Kunle Akande, told Daily Trust that the decision became imperative having realised that it would be difficult to maintain the recommended social distancing in the premises of the House. “The House took the decision in order to ensure that everyone in the state is safe and in compliance with the directive of the state and federal governments that cancelled gathering of over 50 persons,” he said. Akande recalled that the governor of the state, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola, had banned all public gatherings including churches, mosques and schools to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. Akande said although the state has not recorded any case of the novel coronavirus, all hands must be on deck to contain the spread of the virus in the state.
