Pastor Amos who spoke with our reporter at his residence yesterday in Abaji, said the incident happened around 12:00am. He said he was asleep when the gunmen invaded his home, and explained that their footsteps woke him and that he peeped throgh the window, saw heavily armed men approaching his front door. He said, “One of them barked orders that I should   open the door and I asked them why. Before I knew what was happening, they forced the door open.” Pastor Amos further said after the gunmen held his children, they proceeded to his neighbour’s apartment and abducted a couple. He said he had established contact with the abductors and that they were demanding N10m ransom.
