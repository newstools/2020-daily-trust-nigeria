 The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has approved the reconstitution of its Ondo State executive into the state caretaker committee with effect from April 5, 2020, when its current tenure is to elapse. The NWC’s decision is predicated on the party’s inability to conduct the state congress scheduled for Tuesday, March 24, 2020, due to the COVID-19 stay at home and social distancing directives issued by the federal government to curtail the spread of the virus. The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said by the approval, the state executive has been empowered to act as a state caretaker committee until it is possible to conduct state congress for the election of state officials, “provided that they shall not serve in such capacity for more than three months” from April 5, 2020.
