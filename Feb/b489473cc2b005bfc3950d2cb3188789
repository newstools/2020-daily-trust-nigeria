European Union Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Ketil Karlsen has urged politicians to show restraints in their quest for power. Karlsen gave the advice yesterday in Benin during a visit to Chief Dan Orbih, state Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and leaders of the party. He also appealed for peace and non-violence in the forthcoming Edo governorship election, adding that the EU was also meeting with other political parties on the same message. He advocated collaborative effort in order to amend the electoral law and pledged EU’s willingness to support the process. He explained that the EU has over 3,000 projects across the Niger Delta and was partnering with Edo Government on many projects. Karlsen also noted the role of the EU in the repatriation of youths trapped along illegal migrants’ routes and rehabilitating them to cut the illegal trade.(NAN)  EU invests 165m euros on renewable energy in Nigeria EU empowers 17,000 adolescents in North-east EU, British Council launch €13.5m for Nigeria grassroots development
