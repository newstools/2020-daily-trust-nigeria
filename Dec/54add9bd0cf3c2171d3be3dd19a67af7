The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, has inaugurated a new operation command centre built by APM Terminals, Apapa, to boost efficiency and service delivery. Amaechi, while inaugurating the terminal, said the rail line when completed would facilitate the movement of containers out of Apapa Port, thereby reducing pressure on the roads. This was contained in a statement by the Nigeria Country Manager of APM Terminals, Mr Klaus Laursen, in Lagos on Monday. According to Laursen, the new operation command centre will, among other benefits, strengthen exchange of information and coordination in the movement of containers out of the port, enhance operational efficiency and provide a better work environment. “The centre is the brain of the business. It is about day-to-day execution where information is exchanged. This is where we decide which box to put where, at which time, and the equipment to pick so that everything works together.
