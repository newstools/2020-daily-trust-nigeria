The Edo State Government has hinted of plans to increase the recently completed 55MW CCETC-Ossiomo power plant’s generation capacity to 550MW. A statement by the media aide to the governor, Crusoe Osagie, indicated that the project, which will be implemented in three phases, would transform the state’s power sector, allowing for the liberalisation of the market. Osagie stated: “The next phase of our power project is the design and engineering phase comprising a 550MW Gas Engine IPP to be constructed in three phases with the first phase scheduled for commissioning in the last quarter of 2021.” Crusoe further said delivery of the power project was premised on the securing of three critical licenses by the company from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), comprising a Generation License, an Independent Electricity Distribution Network License and an Eligible Customer (willing buyer-willing seller) approval.
