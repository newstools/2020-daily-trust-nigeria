Unknown gunmen last week shot dead a 300- level Biochemistry student of the Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba Akoko (AAUA), Mr Olakunle Matthew Olayinka. The university’s management, in a statement signed on Saturday by the acting Registrar, Opeoluwa Akinfemiwa, announced that apart from the loss of the Biochemistry student, the school also lost a 200-level student of the Department of Educational Management, Miss Temitope Patience Ayedun, who died last Thursday at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, Ondo State. The statement said the news of Olayinka’s death was received last Friday night after medical personnel at the university’s Health Centre had put up spirited efforts to stabilise him after he was shot. The management added that security agents were still on the trail of the assailants. “The University management, under the leadership of the Ag. Vice Chancellor, Professor Olugbenga  Ige, commiserates with the families of the deceased, the entire students and the university community on these sad events, and prays that the Lord consoles the families and the entire university community. “The Ag. Vice Chancellor, on behalf of the University Senate has, therefore, directed that the first semester university-wide GST and ENT CBT examinations for 2019/2020 academic session earlier scheduled for Monday March 9, 2020 to Thursday, March 12, 2020 be postponed till further notice. “All students are enjoined to remain calm and go about their lawful activities without panic as management, in conjunction with the security agencies, are on top of the situation,” the statement said.
