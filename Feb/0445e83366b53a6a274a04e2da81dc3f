 The Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, has attributed the high cases of flight to the malfunctioning of some components of the recently acquired Category 3 instrument landing system being installed at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport, Lagos. A statement by the   Director, Public Affairs, Federal Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu, assured the public and the airlines that efforts are on to return the system to full working condition and that normalcy of operations will be re-established in due course. He stated, “With great concern, the experiences of air travellers to and from the Murtala Muhammed International airport Lagos regarding flight diversions and, in many cases, outright cancellations, which have been occasioned by highly inclement weather conditions.” “While these developments are greatly regretted, we wish to let the public know that the authorities at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos were in the process of replacing the old Category 2 Instrument Landing Systems with the newly procured Category 3 system that allows for the lowest visibility landing. “Unfortunately, there was a malfunctioning of certain components, which, coupled with the unforeseen weather conditions, made landing at the airport difficult.” “The procurement of the Category 3 Instrument landing System is in pursuance of the desire of the Federal Government to ensure the safety of air passengers by ensuring that airplanes can land with almost zero visibility” it explained. On the diversion of incoming international flights to neighbouring countries, the minister said it is purely those of the airlines which we have no control over.
