Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), George Moghalu, has hinted about government’s plans to register boat operators in Nigerian waterways. Moghalu who gave this hint at the palace of Obong of Calabar, Edidem Ekpo Okon Abasi, V, said the essence of the registration is to enable them monitor their activities to reduce the rate of accidents on the waterways where many lives are usually lost. The NIWA boss said the Authority will ensure that they provide lifejackets to all seafarers plying the waterways for business or pleasure. He said even though they may not be able to provide boats in all the area offices yet, they will want to ensure that all operators comply with necessary laws guiding operations of the waterways. The managing director said he will revive waterway travel, which he said is about the cheapest means of transportation in the country. “We will make life jackets available at the area offices and we hope this will reduce the rate of accidents along the waterways.  We will ensure that all operators comply with the laws guiding water operations and with the fees they should pay to the authority,” he said. Although Moghalu said the authority cannot afford enough boats to go round the various waterways in the country, he promised to make some boats available to the Calabar area office to enhance water transportation. In his remarks, the Obong of Calabar, assured that his community would always be kindly disposed to all efforts geared towards socio-economic and cultural developments of the region.  ‘Nigeria’s waterways have great potentials’ Nigeria’s Inland Waterways: The untapped cash cow 3 killed in Lagos boat mishap
