Mayhem was averted in Owerri, the Imo State capital, as a clash between youths loyal to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was quelled before it degenerated. PDP youths under the aegis of concerned Imo citizens had mobilised for another protest against the January 14, 2020 Supreme Court judgement which ousted Emeka Ihedioha and declared Sen. Hope Uzodinma as the governor. But their APC counterparts had mobilised to counter the protest. The APC youths set up bonfire with tyres to prevent the protesters from coming out of the Ugwu Ekwema Hall where they had assembled along Egbu road. However the APC youths were chased away by the protesters, who continued their action. Addressing the protesters, the convener of the Concerned Imo citizens, Engr. Kingsley Onwubiko, said the Supreme Court judgement which declared Uzodinma as the governor had not only destabilised the state but brought agony to people. He insisted that the people would continue to protest until the justices of the apex court set aside what be described as a great injustice to the people of the state. Also, Mr. Charles Oputa (Charly Boy) popular musician and the convener of OURMUMUDONDO said Imo people are not satisfied with the apex court judgement which he described as a miscarriage of justice and appealed the justices of the court to correct it.
