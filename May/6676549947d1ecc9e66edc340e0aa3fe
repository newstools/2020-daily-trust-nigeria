Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Abuja have lamented that they cannot observe social distancing or adhere to other measures against coronavirus while hungry, as that is not what matters to them at the moment. The IDPs who are mostly from Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, said what mattered to them was how to secure jobs to earn money and feed themselves and their families. They said feeding and sustaining themselves were more important to them than adhering to precautionary measures against the disease as being preached by government and other concerned groups in the country. Chairman of IDPs at New Kuchingoro camp, Abuja, Philemon Emmanuel, speaking to journalists after receiving donation of food items from a non-governmental organisation, Otunba Adejare Adegbenro Foundation (OAAF), over the weekend said his people have refused to observe safety measures because they believe coronavirus does not exist.

He said although prior to the lockdown declared by the federal government, the National Emergency Management Agency, (NEMA) had given them two buckets and liquid soap to encourage them to practice hand washing,  they were not paying attention to that. “Two days to the lockdown, NEMA came here with two buckets. One was empty while the other contained liquid soap. They said we should use it to wash our hands to prevent contracting coronavirus but our people are interested in getting food’’, he said. While presenting the items to the IDPs, a member of the Board of Trustee of OAAF, Shehu Umar Bida, explained that the donation was borne out of the foundation’s desire to identify with the less privileged and the vulnerable.
