A 40-year-old man, Abraham Olanrenwaju, who allegedly assaulted a security guard on duty at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos, was yesterday charged before an Igbosere magistrate court, Lagos, with a three-count criminal charge bordering on assault. Olanrenwaju, according to police prosecutor, Tope Adega, committed the offence on March 4, 2020 at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, when he assaulted Olamide Oyewole. The defendant also allegedly assaulted a police corporal, Aliyu Samaila, by resisting arrest and hitting him with a blow on the mouth. Adega also alleged that the accused person conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of public peace by parking his vehicle for eight days at an unauthorised place, which affected the free flow of traffic. Olanrewaju pleaded not guilty to the charge the police levelled against him and was admitted to bail in the sum of N50,000 by Magistrate A. A. Runsewe, who fixed trial for March 23, 2020.
