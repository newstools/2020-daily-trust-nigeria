An elder statesman and foremost Nigerian politician, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, has disputed a claim by a former colonial official, Harold Smith, that the British rigged the 1959 General Elections for the North to control Nigeria. In an article titled ‘My take on the claim of alleged British manipulation of the outcome of the pre-independence Nigerian federal elections’ made available to Daily Trust, Yakasai, 94, described the claim as an attempt to rubbish the history of the country. “It is a bunch of lies and disjointed attempt to ravish our country and her history. That man was a hired agent recruited to do that dirty job to entertain whoever was responsible for hiring him to do his bidding,” he said.
