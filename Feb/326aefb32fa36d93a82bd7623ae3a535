A former Anambra State Commissioner for Land and Survey, Barr. Okoli Akirika has called on the National Assembly to amend the Constitution to ensure seamless succession of democratically elected Local Government officers in the country. Akirika who was reacting to the Supreme Court judgement that barred state governors from appointing caretaker committee in place of elected officers to run the affairs of local government. Despite the apex court judgement, he said there is lacuna in the constitution which governors capitalised on to appoint caretaker committee to run local government affairs. Akirika who was the former state chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance APGA, said  the  lacuna in the 1999 constitution that  allows state governors to perpetuate illegality by appointing caretaker committee to run the administration of local government council must be addressed. According to him, the constitution clearly states that  state governors shall put every machinery in place to ensure  the existence of democratically elected government in local government area, but  the same constitution did not say  such system must be  in  place and how.
