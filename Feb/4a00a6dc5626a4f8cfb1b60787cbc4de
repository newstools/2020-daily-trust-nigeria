The Senate, on Thursday, expressed concern that the annual national budgets were not reflective of the national development plans. The Senate, accordingly, mandated its committee on National Planning, Finance and Appropriation to hold a round table meeting with agencies in budgeting process to conduct a thorough review of budgeting practices and national planning process, with a view to creating a more synergized and collaborative system that is both effective and efficient. The resolution was sequel to the motion “the need to establish a visionary budget-driven National Planning Framework for Nigeria” by Senator Stella Oduah (Anambra North) and five others. Senator Oduah, in her lead debate, said the approval of budget submissions by MDAs to the National Assembly were not reflective of goal-oriented and performance-based allocations. She said despite Nigeria’s articulated national plans over the years, it continues to adopt annual national budgets that do not reflect a buy-in from relevant stakeholders and MDAs. She noted that without a visionary budget-driven national development plan, growth strategies and the respective MDAs will continue to fall short of achieving their goals, and projects will have little or no purpose. “There will continue to be a high propensity for wasteful resource allocation and/or overlapping projects,” she said. Briefing reporters after the plenary, the lawmaker said the budgetary allocation should be tied to national development plans. “For every budgetary process, there must be planning and budgeting should be tied to growth plan,” she said. Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (Niger North) said the non-implementation of development plans was responsible for the many abandoned projects nation-wide.
