The United Bank for Africa (UBA) has upgraded its mobile banking application, introducing interactive features to aid banking while allowing customers to perform unlimited transactions with simple taps on their mobile phones. Disclosing the features during a Webinar attended by our reporter, the Group Head, Digital Banking, Sampson Aneke, who spoke about the new features of the upgraded mobile app, said UBA as a listening institution, aimed to provide the best value possible for its customers through a more interactive, user-friendly interface that made available a myriad of opportunities from the comfort of customers’ homes. He explained that the new mobile app would now prompt users to use their device-enabled biometrics, adding that the menu had been reduced and divided into sub-menus to enable users view transaction history, net worth, trends, among others at a glance. He explained that, “With the new interface, the user can now see all the transfer options, including the saved beneficiary option, at a glance and can even order food for delivery via the app.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.

He further explained that, “Another exciting feature that we have already started receiving rave feedback from our customers for is the one that enables users make loan requests via Click Credit (for salary account holders) or quick loans which is available to both savings and current account holders. Our customers have already started to enjoy these services, and I can tell you that they are very pleased with these new offerings.”
