The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, has charged everyone to emulate the recipient of 2019 Daily Trust African Award, Madame Rosalia Mashale. Farouq, who was the special guest of honour at the award dinner held yesterday, said the recognition of Mama Rosie was “timely and heart-warming”. “I wish to encourage us to emulate this great woman and let’s begin to see what we can do for our persons of concerns that are within and around us in Africa. “Her selection, which is based on her humanitarian activities in saving thousands of abandoned children affected by HIV/AIDS in some of the poorest communities in South Africa, is a testimony to the tremendous good work that one person can do. This is indeed commendable.” ‘Why Mama Rosie won Daily Trust African of the Year Award’ Daily Trust 2019 African of the Year arrives Nigeria Mama Rosie emerges 2019 Daily Trust African of the Year
