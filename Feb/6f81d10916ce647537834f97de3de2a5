The last of the four seminarians recently kidnapped from Good Shepherd Major Seminary, Kaduna, and wife of a Kaduna-based medical doctor, Philip Ataga, also kidnapped, have been found dead. The seminarian, identified as Brother Nnadi Michael, was kidnapped alongside four other seminarians from the seminary premises in Kakau, along Kaduna-Abuja expressway on January 8, 2020. While the other three victims were released on Friday, the Seminary Registrar, Rev. Fr. (Dr.) Joel Usman disclosed that the corpse of Nnadi Michael was discovered on Saturday night. The registrar said “This is to inform all our friends and wellwishers that the remaining abducted seminarian has been found dead. Thank you very much for your prayerful support. Let us keep praying for Nigeria in great distress.” Also, the wife of a Kaduna-based medical doctor, Philip Ataga, who was abducted by kidnappers along with her two children, on January 25, has been found dead along the Abuja-Kaduna highway. The woman and her two children were abducted from their home at Juji community in Chikun Local Government Area of the state by kidnappers who also killed a member of a local vigilante group in the area during the kidnap. One week after the abduction, the woman’s body was found on Saturday morning while the whereabouts of her two children remains unknown. Spokesman of Kaduna State Police Command, DSP Yakubu Sabo, said the woman’s bullet-riddled body was discovered in a bush in the Kakau area along the Abuja-Kaduna highway and deposited at a mortuary.
