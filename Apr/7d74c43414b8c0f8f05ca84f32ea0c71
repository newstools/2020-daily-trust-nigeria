A former Senate president, David Mark, has urged law enforcement agencies to respect human rights procedures while enforcing the federal governmentâ€™s stay-at-home order. President Muhammadu Buhari, in a televised broadcast on Sunday, ordered cessation of movements for an initial period of 14 days in Lagos, Ogun and the FCT to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. Mark, in a statement by his media aide, Paul Mumeh, said applying the internationally accepted standards of enforcement has become necessary to avoid creating more problems. According to him, the unabating spread of the virus reinforced the urgent need for all citizens to comply with the stay-at-home order including observation of personal hygiene, regular washing of hands and the application of hand sanitiser to curtail the pandemic. He, therefore, urged the citizens to accept the discomfort and cooperate with the authorities to curtail and ultimately end the virus. The former Senate helmsman also urged the federal government to work out modalities towards providing palliatives for the citizens to ameliorate the pains of the lockdown. He reminded the authorities that the primary objective of government is the welfare and security of the citizenry, a task he described as a sacred covenant with the people. Senator Mark said the scourge would be surmountable only if all citizens complied with the preventive measures no matter the discomfort.
