A 35-year-old woman, Mrs Folasade Ayo, has approached a Grade B Customary Court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, seeking the dissolution of her 15-year-old marriage with her husband over what she described as “betrayal and absconding.” Ayo, a former banker, told the court that her estranged husband had abandoned her and gone to Italy since 2011, leaving her and their two children. The petitioner said, “It is unfortunate that I am legally married to an ungrateful man, who sold the car we both contributed money to buy. Even, I contributed the highest amount to purchase the car because my salary was higher than his. “He travelled out of the country and abandoned my children and I for over eight years without any communication.” According to her, they were both living in Akure before they relocated to Kaduna in 2008 when she got a job with a bank there, while her husband was employed by an insurance company in Kaduna. She told the court, “When I was seven months pregnant with my second child, I requested for a month’s leave at my office. So we decided to pay a visit, in August 2012, to our family members living in Akure. ”We all arrived at my mother’s house, where we spent the night. The following day, I woke up and could not find my husband. I called his line, but it was switched off. I called a neighbour in Kaduna to ask if he had seen her husband and he replied that he saw him 15 minutes ago. “The following day, I headed to Kaduna. But on getting there, I discovered that my husband had moved out his property. I informed our family members after some days and one of his cousins advised me not to worry but move on with my life and take good care of my child and the pregnancy.”  Policeman seeks end to 25-yr old marriage over wife’s affair with pastor 79-year-old prophet seeks divorce of nine years marriage I have been paying our house rent for 18 years, divorce-seeking wife tells court
