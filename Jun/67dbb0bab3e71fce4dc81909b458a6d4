A Benin High Court has affirmed that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the September 19 governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, is a registered member of the party. Deputy chairman of the party in Edo, Kenneth Asekomhe, and three others, Benjamin Oghumu, Matthew Ogbebor and Unweni Nosa, had filed the suit challenging the decision of the APC granting a waiver to Ize-Iyamu, to make him eligible to contest the APC primary election. The defendants in the suit are APC, Adams Oshiomhole, and Ize-Iyamu. The plaintiff had prayed the court to restrain APC from recognising Ize-Iyamu as an aspirant of the party in its governorship primary election. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. In his ruling, Justice Emmanuel Ahamioje, said Ize-Iyamu did not require a waiver to contest. According to him, the membership of a party is an internal affair of the political party and that rendered it non-justiciable before the court.
