The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to restore police security attached to the Rivers State Task Force on COVID-19 pandemic. The party stressed that the withdrawal of the Police from the Rivers Task Force amounted to politicizing the efforts to check the spread of COVID-19 in the country. The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan observed that the withdrawal of the police personnel would only lead to lawlessness as well as frustrate the efforts of the Rivers State Government to ensure compliance to health safety protocols put in place to check the spread of COVID-19 and safeguard the lives of Nigerians in the state. “Our party acknowledges the efforts of Governor of Rivers State, Chief Nyesom Wike, as well as those of other state governors elected on the platform of the PDP to flatten the curve in their respective states even without commensurate support from the Federal Government led by President Muhammadu Buhari.

In another statement issued by Ologbondiyan yesterday, the PDP called on the Buhari administration to “end its unnecessary political parochialism and mobilize our indigenous researchers for homegrown solution in the interest of our nation.” Covid 19: Police collecting N500 bribe to grant passage at boundaries- Cross River govt Coronavirus: Scientists urge FG to lock down Nigeria now Police arraign 65 party goers for violating lockdown
