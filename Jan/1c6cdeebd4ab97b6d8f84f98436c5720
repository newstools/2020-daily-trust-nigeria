The Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry Mines and Agriculture (KADCIMMA) on Wednesday confirmed that over 700 exhibitors were expected to attend the 41st Kaduna International Trade Fair slated to kick off on February 28 this year. The President of Chamber, Dr. Muheeba Farida Dankaka, disclosed this when she led a delegation from the Chamber to the headquarters of Media Trust Limited, in Abuja. Dankaka said the exhibitors were being expected from within and outside the country at the  Fair and expressed optimism that exhibitors at this year’s event would surpass those that attended in 2019. She said the Fair, with the theme ‘Unlocking Nigeria’s Economic Potentials through Regional Integration’, would feature a Trade Fair Seminar, business roundtables; quiz competition for secondary school students across the 19 northern states and other side attractions. Dankaka said the choice of the theme of the Fair was informed by the need to discuss opportunities inherent in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA) pact, which is aimed at integrating the economies of the African continent. The KADCCIMA boss said adequate arrangements had been made to ensure the safety of the exhibitors and visitors throughout the 10-day period of the Fair. She said the security situation as reported in the media is blown out of proportion as Kaduna is safe for both visitors and exhibitors. “I assure you that the number of participants this year will be higher than what we recorded last year,” she said.
