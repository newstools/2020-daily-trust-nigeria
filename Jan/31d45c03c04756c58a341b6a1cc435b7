There was palpable tension last Friday in Apomu Central mosque, the headquarters of Isokan Local Government Area of Osun State, following the emergence of two Chief Imams in the town. It was gathered that supporters of the two Clerics, parading as Chief Imams, Ismail Eniafe and his rival, Alhaji Olawale, have been boasting to cause mayhem in the town if ‘Suroh’ Committee (Kingmakers) allowed any of them to lead Jumaat prayer at the mosque. Daily Trust reports that the two clerics were turbaned at separate venues last Thursday, with a view to leading prayers on Friday, barely one month after the demise of former Chief Imam, Alh. Muritadoh Akintayo, who died on November 28, 2019. Our Correspondent, who was at the mosque, saw large crowd of youths loyal to both parties, and the security operatives, including Police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in their large numbers, also on ground to forestall breaking of law and order. Speaking with Daily Trust, a supporter of Alhaji Olawale, who simply identified himself as Alfa Olohunosebi, said the selection of Chief Imam is not complicated, arguing that it is a tradition to pick ‘Nahibu-l-Imam’ (Second-in-Command) to occupy the position if the former occupier joins his ancestors. He said, “Alhaji Olawale is the best person to fill the vacant position of Chief Imam. He is the person who is next to Late Chief Imam. I wonder why some youths are going against such a tradition. They should allow peace to reign and stop threatening people with charms.” But one of the Eniafe’s supporters, who simply identified himself as Lekan, faulted the claim, saying that there was no any written agreement as regards who is supposed to occupy the position when it becomes vacant.
