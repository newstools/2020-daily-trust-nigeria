The leadership of the Association of Cashew Farmers, Aggregators and Processors of Nigeria (ACFAP) has said that it would work with relevant agencies and private sector players to check the activities of a cabal now undermining the economic interest of smallholder farmers and investors. The president of the association, Engr Unekwuojo Edime, who gave this hint at a media briefing in Abuja, said stakeholders at a  recent cashew summit agreed to eliminate major encumbrances to cashew value chain export earnings in the country. He said: “As you may be aware, several cashew associations have been in existence before now and some had the reputation of being around for over fifteen years in this industry but remain encumbered by domestic conspiracy facilitated by those interloping middlemen that buy raw cashew nut from farmers at their own determined prices. “This trend must be checked in the interest of transparency and the relevant executive orders in place by the government in order to restore hope to our rural dwellers, the vulnerable groups and most especially those whose only hope is hopelessness as a result of organised conspiracy”, Edime added. The industry leader said the group was working with the Tak Integrated Agro, a value chain actor, and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to enhance the profitability of the Nigerian cashew produce at the international market. He said Tak Integrated  was setting up six cashew processing factories across the country and will collaborate with other export-certifying bodies to ensure that the country’s cashew meet international standard.
