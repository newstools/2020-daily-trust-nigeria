A group known as Women in Leadership Initiative (WiLI) has expressed concern over purported secret moves to bury a case pertaining defilement of a 7-year-old girl by a teacher at the Jos Upper Area Court 2, Kabong. In a statement signed by its chairperson, M. B. Muhammad on Monday, the group accused some influential individuals in Jos of alleged plots to frustrate the court proceeding and cover up the misdeed in favour of the teacher identified as Ishaq Mika’il Ishaq. Narrating the development in the statement, the group noted that “The case involves one teacher Ishaq Mika’il Ishaq, who is also a photographer with one of the major religious groups in the country, who allegedly raped one Safiya Musa (not real name) in 2018, who was 7-years-old at the time of the alleged offense. The case has been lingering for two years at the Upper Area Court in Kabong.”The group further described the development as unfortunate and vowed to take necessary and lawful measures to ensure that justice prevails, adding that it will not stand aside and watch while some selfish interests hatch schemes to frustrate the case. In the statement, the group further said it will challenge any form of molestation of women especially girls in society by any person no matter their status.  ...
