Kaduna State Government has reverted to the two-day window for residents to restock food and other essential items stressing that Wednesdays and Saturdays will henceforth be lockdown free in the state. A statement on Monday by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Muyiwa Adekeye, said the decision was taken after the daily meeting of the State Standing Committee on Covid-19 headed by Deputy Governor Hadiza Balarabe. El-Rufai had on Sunday extended the state’s lockdown by another 30 days. Adekeye stated: “This week Wednesday, residents wearing face masks can go to shops and markets selling foods and medicines to restock” adding that ”all markets will be closed after Wednesday to be replaced by temporary neighbourhood markets which will commence operations this Saturday.” “Sellers of food and medicines will be allocated spaces in public schools and other public facilities so that they can serve specific neighbourhoods. Every effort will be made to site these temporary markets within walking distance so that people can pick their groceries and other essentials right in their local areas,” it stated. The statement explained that the temporary neighbourhood markets will operate from 10am to 4pm on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and social distancing will be observed during their operations. It stated that details of the locations approved for the temporary neighbourhood markets and the rules of their operations would be announced later; while persons already running neighbourhood shops that sell food and provisions were allowed to open daily. The state government explained that the COVID-19 Standing Committee also approved an enhanced pay package for frontline health workers, adding that it had taken life and disability insurance policies.
