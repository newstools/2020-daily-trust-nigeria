The Alumni Association of Kano University of Science and Technology (KUST), Wudil yesterday issued a statement asking its president, Dr Auwal Yusif Abdullahi to resign his position and instructed the Vice President, Suhail Macciddo to immediately take over the affairs of the alumni. This was contained in a letter jointly signed by the alumni’s congress chairman, Malam Abdullahi Ammani, and its Secretary, Malam Muhammad Inuwa, respectively, which was dispatched to the embattled president with copies made available to newsmen; Kano State Governor;  Vice Chancellor KUST; Kano State Police Commissioner, among others. The statement said the action followed a vote-of-no-confidence in which 303 out of the 378 members that attended the alumni’s emergency meeting voted against the president. The statement further said the letter stood as a notification of an impeachment with immediate effect and accused him of betraying the trust and confidence reposed in him by using the association as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement and meddling in conflicts between the major arms of the university thereby violating laws governing the affairs and conduct of the association.
