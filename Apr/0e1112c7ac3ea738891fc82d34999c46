The Ogun State Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, says some mothers in the state have been giving their children hand sanitisers to drink in their own wisdom of protecting those wards against the contracting coronavirus. Coker disclosed this yesterday while responding to questions from journalists at the Ogun COVID- 19 Situation Room in Abeokuta. The Commissioner described the practice as a ‘myth’, insisting there was no proof that consumption of hand sanitiser would cure or prevent COVID-19. She warned those indulging in the act to desist from it forthwith. Coker described the newly commissioned 128-bed Isolation Centre in Ikenne as the largest facility in Nigeria. The new Isolation Centre was an abandoned Model College constructed by a former governor of the state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. The structure was named after the late Hannah Awolowo, wife of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo. With the new Centre, Ogun State now boasts of three isolation centres. The other two are located at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Ago-Iwoye, and Iberekodo.
