 As the coronavirus outbreak rages in the country, the Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN) yesterday cautioned Nigerians against “indiscriminate and excessive consumption of chloroquine and similar drugs in the quest to obviously prevent COVID-19.” The ACPN noted that its members nationwide had seen “unprecedented demand for chloroquine” since last week’s declaration by the US President Donald Trump approving the drug for the treatment of COVID-19. National President of ACPN, Pharm. Samuel Adekola, in a statement reiterated that chloroquine was only approved for clinical trial. He also said the outbreak had increased the workload of pharmacists at the community level as its members now contend “with panic-stricken clients who are gradually stripping pharmacies of essential items, which are now becoming a lot more difficult to replenish on the shelves. “Community Pharmacists have had to deal with increasing workload caused by panic ordering of drugs in advance but also a directly proportional increase in demand for other basic household care products from antiseptics, soaps, disinfectants and such related products”, Adekola added While allaying fears among members of the public, he disclosed that the association had “successfully liaised with NAFDAC” which has given authorisation for the massive central production of affordable hand sanitisers by local manufacturers. According to him, the affordable hand sanitisers are now available at reasonable prices at community and hospital pharmacies manned by pharmacists nationwide and being sold to clients who need it to maintain good hygienic standards at all times. The pharmacist further disclosed that the ACPN had mandated its members to stock all essential drugs, which will be needed to manage the current public health emergency while it lasts.
