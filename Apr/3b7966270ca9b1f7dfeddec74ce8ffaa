The House of Representatives PDP Caucus has berated the federal government over its response to the health crisis in Kano state describing it as lame, clueless with no practical solutions. In a statement on Tuesday signed by its leader, Kingsley Chinda (PDP, Rivers), the Caucus stated that both Kano State Government, the Federal Government through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 have failed to tackle the situation under control despite the lives being lost. “As a caucus, we join several well-meaning Nigerians to express our concerns over the health crisis in Kano State. “The very recent reports of unprecedented death of scores of people within a few days in Kano State should concern every responsible public officer. “We are indeed deeply concerned and worried about this lacklustre stance of the Federal Government in solving and dealing with an important health issue such as this. “Partisanship is off limit when it comes to matters affecting the lives of our citizens. This statement is therefore beyond politics,” the caucus added. The House of Representatives PDP Caucus reminded that governance at all levels is a serious business, and meant for serious minded persons. “Consequently, we hereby demand an urgent and thorough investigation and practical and affirmative steps by the Federal government into the circumstances surrounding the disturbing mass death in Kano State, with a view to finding lasting solutions to the problem,” it said.
