Members of the Benue State Caucus of the National Assembly have urged the minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, to apologise to the paramount ruler of Tiv kingdom, Tor Tiv, Professor James Ayatse. Addressing newsmen in Makurdi, at the weekend, the caucus including three senators of the state, expressed concern over the crisis generated by the alleged verbal attacks on the traditional ruler who is the chairman of the Benue State Council of Chiefs. “We therefore condemn in very clear and strong terms the minister’s regrettable utterances against the Tor Tiv, His Royal Majesty, Professor James Ayatse, and we urge Senator Akume to de-escalate the ugly situation in the best interest of our dear state and tender an unreserved apology to Tor Tiv. “We find the recent uncomplimentary and derogatory remarks by the minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, most unfortunate, and if allowed to go unchecked, portend grave consequences not only on the image of Benue State but also would set a negative precedence for the present and future generations,” the lawmakers stated. The spokesman of the group, Senator Abba Moro, who was flanked by his colleagues as well as seven members of the House of Representatives from the state, noted that the royal father must be respected without any preconditions by all Benue sons and daughters regardless of their status and locations. Reacting to the lawmakers’ demand, the acting publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, James Ornguga, accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state of conscripting the paramount ruler into its fold. “We find this act by the PDP in Benue, especially the so-called “Benue National Assembly Caucus” as needless meddlesomeness into a matter that should be the exclusive preserve of Tiv Area Traditional Council; this is akin to an attempt to quench fire with petrol,” he stated.
