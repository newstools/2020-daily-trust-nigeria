The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) installed seven transformers and a reactor to raise its bulk power evacuation capacity to the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) between January and the mid of February, 2020. Records obtained from the company on Tuesday indicate that the firm installed four power transformers in Lagos and three others in three states. The Managing Director of TCN, Mr. Usman Gur Mohammed, said as between 2017 and October, 2019, the company which was the link between the GenCos and the DisCos had installed 58 power transformers nationwide. Analysis of the eight power equipment installations shows that in the Lagos region, TCN installed a 730 mega volt ampere (MVA) transformer capacity at the Aja transmission substation, a 345MVA transformer at the Egbin substation, another 265MVA transformer at Ogba substation and a 135MVA transformer at the Apapa substation. Both Ikeja and Eko DisCos will benefit from these projects as they should have more quantum of energy delivered to them to service electricity consumers. In Delta State, the company installed a 510MVA power transformer in Asaba, a major transmission substation supplying bulk power to the Benin DisCo. TCN also installed a 40MVA transformer in Etsako town of Edo State, as well as replaced a Maximum Power Reactor at the Benin transmission substation. Available records show that the reactor which was gulped in a fire earlier in 2019 was replaced to stabilise electricity voltage level on the national grid, especially as it affects bulk power delivery to the network of the Benin DisCo. A transformer was also added to the transmission substation at Gusau in Zamfara State to boost the bulk power delivery capacity of TCN to the network of the Kaduna DisCo in the state.
