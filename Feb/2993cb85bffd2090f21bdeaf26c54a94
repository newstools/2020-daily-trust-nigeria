A former Minister of Education, Dr Obiageli Ezekwesili, has said that it is high time Nigeria dismantled the monopoly of old politicians lording it over the younger ones. Ezekwesili, a former presidential candidate, who spoke in Lagos at a #FixPolitics conference organised by the Robert Bosch Academy, said the present situation in the country did not reflect participatory democracy. According to her, such a system run by the elderly doesn’t bring about progress but stagnation. “When you look at the degree of participation in a democracy, it will tell you whether such democracy is participatory or a monopoly. A monopoly democracy is more dangerous than an economic democracy. “To have a monopoly in how the system functions is to retard the system,” she added. Ezekwesili, however, advocated political structural change to enthrone true democratic principles. Earlier, the factional governorship candidate of the APC in the 2019 general elections in Delta State, Prof. Pat Utomi, said Nigeria is in a terrible state as people who don’t understand public service are occupying public offices.
