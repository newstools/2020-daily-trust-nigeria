The Ogun State House of Assembly yesterday asked the Commissioner of Police in the state, Kenneth Ebrimson, to investigate the crisis that erupted among members of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) at the Ijebu-Igbo motor park on Wednesday. The Assembly also called on the House Committee on Transportation to invite the Chairman of the RTEAN in the state, Titilayo Akibu (Efele), for questioning. Some hoodlums had on Wednesday invaded the park, attacked people and destroyed about 25 vehicles. The police arrested no fewer than four suspects in connection with the mayhem. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. The House Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, responding to the submission of Mr Sylvester Abiodun (PDP Ijebu North 1) on the activities of the RTEAN in his constituency, described the hoodlums’ assault on people and destruction of vehicles as “unfortunate.” Oluomo declared that the state government would not allow such dastardly acts to continue. He charged the police to do a thorough investigation into the causes of the crisis and bring the culprits and their sponsors to book. “The Commissioner of Police should immediately intervene. Nobody has the right to disturb the peace of the people. The police should arrest the vandals and their sponsors anywhere they are in the state,” he said. Earlier, Abiodun, who spoke under personal explanation, had told the House that his constituency was turning to a battle ground due to the activities of transport unions. The lawmaker alleged that the RTEAN Chairman was attempting to impose his candidate on the Ijebu-Igbo branch of the union, which he adduced as responsible for the crisis.
