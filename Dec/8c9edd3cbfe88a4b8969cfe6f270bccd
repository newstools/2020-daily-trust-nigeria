A legal practitioner, Barrister Yusuf Shehu Usman, has called for the scrapping of development areas in Nasarawa State to make local governments viable. He said the development areas were not recognised by the constitution, therefore, not provided for in the Federal Revenue Allocation formula for federal, state and local governments. Barrister Yusuf, who is a former attorney-general and commissioner for justice in the state, said the development areas have employed the same number of staff if not more than the local governments, as well as duplicated their structures and functions. ‘‘They, therefore, amount to a burden for the state government as they are financed by the paltry allocation meant for local governments’’, he said.
