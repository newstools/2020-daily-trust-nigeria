The Rivers State Government has closed all schools in the state and directed all religious organisations to restrict their activities as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic. In a broadcast on Friday,  Rivers State Governor,  Nyesom Wike, said that the action was taken in the interest of Rivers State. The closure affects public and private primary,  secondary and tertiary institutions. He said: “Based on the above precautionary measures, the State can be described to be at an alert state. To further strengthen our resolve to protect our citizens, the State Government has taken the following decisions: “1. All schools in the State are to be closed down with effect from Monday, March 23, 2020. “2. All religious organisations are to restrict their activities.” Governor Wike said that his administration took the decision with a deep sense of responsibility. He said: “As you are aware, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has described coronavirus as a global pandemic. This development calls for collective action by all well-meaning citizens. “As a responsive government, even though we have not had a confirmed case of coronavirus, we did not rest on our oars as we set-up a five-man inter-ministerial committee to carry out an aggressive public enlightenment that will protect all those living and doing business in the State from the disease. “This decision was taken because we understand that we are the headquarters of the hydrocarbon industry and also a major commercial hub in the country that attracts people from all walks of life.” Many other Nigerian states have earlier ordered closure of schools as a preventive measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus. 2019: Wike plans for a comeback to Rivers’ Brick House ‘How education is addressing N/Delta agitations’ One year after, Rivers still exposed to cancerous emission
