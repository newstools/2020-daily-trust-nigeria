About 300 school owners across Abuja have been trained on strategies to adopt for safety of pupils when schools are eventually reopened in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS), FCT chapter, which started the training at the weekend, said it would be in batches. The theme of the four-part series is: “Reopening: Insight Series for NAPPS FCT Schools”. The training is held on the meeting app, Zoom webinar. Mrs. Olusola Bankole, the president of the chapter, said, on Saturday during the webinar, that the training was part of the association’s social responsibility. She added that it was in support of the Federal Government’s plan to reopen schools which were closed in March as a result of the pandemic. She further said the series of virtual trainings and workshops on schools reopening would take every aspect of health and safety into consideration. “Other aspects of the webinar seminar are business continuity sessions and finance discussions peculiar to schools in the FCT and the country in general,” she said. Bankole said that over 300 schools registered for the first part of the series, with additional representation from school proprietors from Enugu, Nasarawa, Niger and Kaduna states. “Apart from that, we also have over 100 public school principals and teachers from across the country in attendance. Dr. Bukola Dosunmu, a healthcare expert at the event, said there was the need for schools to make their resumption plans to suit their peculiar structures. She advised that each school should take its staff number and space capacity into consideration.
