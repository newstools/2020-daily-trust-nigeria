A fire broke out on Monday on the topmost floor of one of the towers of the World Trade Centre, Abuja; the tallest residential and commercial building undergoing construction in the city. Daily Trust learnt that the fire, which cause was yet to be ascertained as at press time, started at about 11:30am. When our reporter went to the scene of the incident, he was denied access into the building, but Mr. Ibukun Adeogun, the General Manager, Operations of First Continental Properties, owners of the imposing structure, said the fire was not serious. Mr. Adeogun said internal sprinklers installed in the building were deployed to quench the fire. He further said, “There was a small fire incident at the rooftop, and immediately they saw the fire, our sprinklers system, it is a hi-tech building, was deployed internally and you can see that everything is calm,” adding that there was no damage to the building or any injury to people working in it. However, fire service trucks and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) rescue buses and ambulances were seen within and outside the premises. The Director, FCT Fire Service, Mr. Opetusin Julius, told Daily Trust on phone some minutes to 01:00pm that firemen were still at the scene and so he could not comment on the incident.
