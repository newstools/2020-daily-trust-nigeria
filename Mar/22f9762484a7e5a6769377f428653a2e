The Ogun State police command says it has arrested a secondary school teacher, Chima Azunyere, for allegedly defiling a 14-year-old female student. Azunyere, 23, was said to have been arrested following a report by the girl’s father at the Ibafo divisional headquarters. The father reportedly told the police that the Art teacher lured the student, whose name the police were keeping under wraps, to his residence under the pretence he wanted to assist her on practicals. “On getting to his house, the suspect dragged her into his room, overpowered and forcefully had sex with her, as a result of which the victim bled seriously from her private part,” the victim’s father told police. A statement by the police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, yesterday said that the Divisional Police Officer, Ibafo divisional headquarters, Superintendent Abiodun Ayinde, following receipt of the complaint, detailed his detectives to the residence of the suspect at No. 2, Unity Close, Aseese, where he was promptly arrested.
