The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has threatened to seal up some branches of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) in Abuja, over violations of safety measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. The FCT COVID-19 Enforcement Task Team on Wednesday issued a 24- hour ultimatum to the three affected branches of the bank in Areas 3 and 11 and Central Business District to put the necessary safety measures in place for their customers or risk being sealed up. Chairman of the team, Comrade Ikharo Attah, issued the warning to the management of the bank in Abuja. Attah decried that the lives of customers were endangered at the banks premises as there were clear violations of social distancing and hand washing protocols. “This particular bank (GTB) is not observing Covid-19 safety protocol at all. There is only one thermometer for this large crowd. “I have been to this particular branch for more than four times and this bank enjoys large crowd and we are happy for them. “But it has failed to arrange for its customers to sit and wait. There is no social distancing and most of them are not even wearing face masks. The bank should provide canopy, chairs, and hand washing points. “We are giving them 24 hours to get all all these things in place or risk being sealed up. It will not cost up to N100,000. “They should take the lives of their customers very seriously. Their customers should be treated with utmost dignity. I give them 24 hours,” he said.
