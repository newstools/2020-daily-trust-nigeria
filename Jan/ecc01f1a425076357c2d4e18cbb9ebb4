The Osi-Obanla community in Ife South Local Government Area, Osun State, has mentioned dearth of potable water as the residents’ major plight. The residents said they had been finding life difficult as women and children had to trek long distances to the stream, which they said was their only source of water, to fetch water for drinking and washing at home. An elder, Pa Gabriel Adefisan, on behalf of the people of the community, said the stream water was unhealthy for consumption as it caused water-borne diseases to the people, particularly the children. Pa Adefisan added that the people of the community had approached the Osun Agency for Community and Social Development (Osun CSDP) for assistance in the provision of potable water to alleviate their sufferings. He said, “We realised that we need a borehole in this village because we are suffering from dearth of potable water. We demanded potable water instead of drugs to cure preventable water born diseases.” Adefisan said the people of the community contributed 10 per cent of the total cost of the project, while the CSDP assisted them with 90 per cent of the cost.. “We raised N258,738.50 and got N2,328,646.50 from the CSDP to make up N2,587,385, which is the cost of the drilling of the borehole and reticulation of the water to all the nooks and crannies of the village,” he said. Pa Adefisan lauded the state government, World Bank and CSDP for the gesture and assured that the borehole would be well-maintained.
