The Ondo State government has denied a report which claimed that there is a confirmed case of coronavirus in the state. It however, confirmed that there is a suspected case of a man, who came in from Maryland, United States of America, who is now put in isolation. The state commissioner for health, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, said the people of the state should not panic as the case is not confirmed yet. Adegbenro said: “There is no confirmed case of coronavirus in Ondo State as we speak but we are suspecting a case based on the fact that he arrived recently from the United States. “We are isolating the person already and the blood sample will be taken to Lagos. “It is not a confirmed case and you are also aware that there’s a confirmed case in Ekiti but here, we are suspecting the old man having just arrived from the US and it was discovered that he has been coughing for the past one month.” Daily Trust learnt that the state government will brief the press on the coronavirus situation today (Thursday). Meanwhile, Daily Trust investigation has revealed that the claim that the state government had acquired equipment and equipped the isolation center in Akure to meet the health epidemic situation is false. A top source at the health ministry, who pleaded anonymity, told Daily Trust that there is no proper preparation made by the state government due to lack of funds. The source said there is no laboratory and several other things needed to tackle the coronavirus outbreak in the state.
