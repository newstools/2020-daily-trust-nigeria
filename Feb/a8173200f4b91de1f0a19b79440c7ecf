President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said the federal government had made substantial progress on the situation in the North-east, despite criticisms. Receiving Dr. Christos Christou, the International President of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) at State House, Abuja, Buhari, who said respite and succour would come to all the troubled areas, added that many prominent and wealthy organizations were involved in the process, along with international agencies. He expressed appreciation to Doctors Without Borders for their sacrifices in conflict areas in Nigeria, saying such sacrifices were quite enormous, particularly on non-profit basis. “We know the pathetic situation of children not knowing where their parents are, or the communities they come from, and that was why we established the new Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development. This is to harness and channel resources to such deprived people. “We are grateful to you, we will secure the environment in order for you to do your job. You are not doing it for profit. We remain very appreciative,” the president said in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina. Dr Christou, in his remarks, said Doctors Without Borders is works in 10 states across the country, with 90 per cent of its 3,000 staff being Nigerians, and has budgeted f N17.7bn for year 2020.
