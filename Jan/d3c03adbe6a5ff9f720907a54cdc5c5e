Scarcity of cooking gas has hit residents of Ebonyi state following the closure of not less than 16 major stations in Abakiliki and its environs. Governor David Umahi had last week directed immediate shutdown of all illegal gas stations and outlets in the State. Umahi insisted that all gas stations and outlets must meet the approved standard set by the State Capital Territory Development Board (ACTDB) and Department of Petroleum Resources, (DPR). This development has caused untold hardship to consumers of the product as hundreds were on Monday spotted in the streets and major roads of Abakiliki searching for the product. Daily Trust observed that 9 out of the 10 major stations visited in the capital city among which were, Hariz, Dandilas, Lopa, among others were under lock and key with the state government instruction. Our correspondent who went round Abakiliki metropolis essentially the major roads like Ogoja road, old Enugu road and its surroundings observed that major stations could not survive the clampdown by the state government. A gas attendant affected by the directive, Mr. Chukwudi (second name withheld) told Daily Trust on Monday that the closure was not due to environmental compliance but largely the huge tax rate introduced by the state government. He alleged further that the new tax rate spans over 43 million annually for major gas stations in the state. Findings revealed that some consumers who could not lay their hands on the product have reversed to the use of kerosene. At the point of filing in this report, many consumers were roaming the streets in search of cooking gas.
