Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly Mudashiru Obasa says the removal of two principal officers of the house and suspension of two other members were aimed at ensuring that the legislature remains strengthened and its sanctity maintained. The House had after a voice vote on Monday removed Hon. Rotimi Abiru and Hon. Olumuyiwa Jimoh as chief whip and deputy majority leader respectively over what it described as gross misconduct, insubordination and actions capable of destabilising the house. Two members of the house, including Hon. Moshood Oshun, representing Lagos Mainland Constituency 2 and Hon. Kazeem Raheem Adewale representing Ibeju Lekki Constituency 2, were also suspended indefinitely during the plenary on Monday. Obasa said the legislature must remain strong at all times while handling matters concerning Nigeriaâ€™s democracy. The House, however, named two lawmakers as replacement for the principal officers that were impeached on Monday. The members had unanimously elected Hon. Noheem Adams, representing Eti-Osa constituency I, as the Deputy Majority Leader, while Mojisola Lawal-Meranda representing Apapa constituency I, was elected as the new Chief Whip.
