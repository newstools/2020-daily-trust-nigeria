The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State yesterday announced the suspension of Engineer Bayo Dayo as the State Chairman over alleged anti-party activities. The PDP faction loyal to the partyâ€™s gubernatorial candidate in 2019 election, Senator Buruji Kashamu, had in February suspended Semiu Sodipo as the State Secretary. The Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Oyejide Sunkanmi in a statement, said Dayo was suspended at a meeting of the State Working Committee (SWC) held on March 26. He said the SWC had resolved to send its complaints of anti-party activities against Dayo to the National Executive Committee of the party for disciplinary measures to be considered. While explaining that the suspension will last for one month in the first instance, Sunkanmi disclosed that the State Deputy Chairman, Samson Bamgbose had been authorised to act as State Chairman. All efforts to reach Dayo for his reaction proved abortive as his mobile phones were switched off.
