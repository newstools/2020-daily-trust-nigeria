A 39-year-old woman, Chioma Akinbaye, was yesterday arraigned before an Ado-Ekiti chief magistrate court over alleged fraud. The police prosecutor, Inspector Johnson Okunade, told the court that Akinbaye committed the offence sometime in January 2020 at the Adebayo area of Ado-Ekiti. Okunade alleged that the defendant fraudulently converted a sum of N145,000, belonging to a complainant, Mr Mahmood Badru, to her own use. The prosecutor said Akinbaye collected the money from some people ostensibly to get goods for them from the complainant, but she collected the goods and did not deliver the money. Rather, it was alleged, she converted it to her own use. Okunade asked the court for an adjournment to enable him study the case file and present his witnesses. Akinbaye pleaded not guilty in court. Her counsel, Mr Olawumi Olowofela, urged the court to grant her bail, with a promise she would not jump bail. The chief magistrate, Mrs Olanike Adegoke, granted bail to the defendant in the sum of N100,000, with one surety in like sum, and adjourned the case till July 3, 2020 for mention. 50-year-old woman arraigned over breach of peace Man, 33, arraigned in court over fraud, theft Police sue 27-year-old man for alleged fraud, fake bank alerts
