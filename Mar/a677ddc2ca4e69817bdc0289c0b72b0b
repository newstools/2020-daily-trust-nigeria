..He’s an overzealous supporter -Presidency Kebbi state government has faulted report that the man who charged at President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Argungu area of the state was shot. An unidentified man was restrained by security operatives while attempting to move towards Buhari, who was in the state for the 2020 Argungu Fishing Festival. Gunshot-like noises were heard as the man was dragged out of the venue. In an amateur video obtained by Daily Trust, the man was seen moving close to the president. It was believed that the man had penetrated the president’s tight security and attempted to go close to him before Buhari’s security detail prevented him. However, the state government in a statement by the SA Media to Kebbi State Governor, Yahaya Sarki, on Friday, claimed that “that the young man in the video, out of his love for Buhari attempted to shake the president’s hand and the security personnel around him prevented the man from doing so”. He added that no single shot was fired by the security agents throughout Mr President’s visit to Argungu, stressing that Buhari was not attacked in the state. He disclosed that further information will be made available to the press after the conclusion of investigation by DSS.  <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Operatives of the Department of State Security were said to have later carried the man to an unknown location. When contacted on the telephone last night, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, confirmed the incident, saying the man was an overzealous supporter of the president who did not know that he had crossed the line of security. Shehu said: “He is an overzealous supporter who wanted to reach the president clearly out of goodwill. He didn’t know the limit and the security implication. He didn’t know that he was crossing the line of security.” But sources alleged that the man was an aggrieved Nigerian who wanted to attack the president.
