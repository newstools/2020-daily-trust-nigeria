A public affairs analyst, Jibrin Ibrahim, told Daily Trust on Sunday on telephone that civil disobedience would not help the PDP.  He argued that the Supreme Court would simply ignore the party if it does not follow due process in handling the issue. Ibrahim advised that the party should bring its team of lawyers together and prepare its argument on why the court should revisit and reverse the judgment. “The Supreme Court is the final court in the land. So what I think they should do is to prepare their superior argument that the judgment was wrong and try to persuade the court to revisit it,” he said. Calling for CJN’s removal irresponsible – Yadudu Also reacting, Prof Auwalu Yadudu (SAN) described the call for removal of the Chief Justice of Nigeria as “irresponsible” because decisions of the Supreme Court are by a panel, which the CJN is only a member. He added that in the case of Imo State governorship, the seven member panel arrived at a unanimous decision. “It’s a bit strange that the party has just found their voice now to ask the CJN to recuse himself. Where were they when the same court presided by the CJN decided to overturn and award the entire electoral offices in Zamfara State from the state governor down to members of the House of Assembly, Senate and House of Representatives to the PDP? Where were they when the same Supreme Court with the same CJN completely disallowed the opposition from participating in the governorship election in Rivers State? Was it because it served them? That is why I said the call is irresponsible,”  he said.
