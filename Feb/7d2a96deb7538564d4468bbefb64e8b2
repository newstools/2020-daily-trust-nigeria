The Transparency Advocacy for Development Initiative (TADI) has urged Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State to ignore those opposing the appointment of the pioneer Vice Chancellor of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Prof. Sidi Osho, as Education Commissioner in the state. The Executive Director, TADI, Ambassador Yomi David, said on Tuesday in Abuja that opposition to Mrs, Osho’s appointment is retrogressive and against tenets of good governance and political development in the state. “Prof. Sidi Osho was awarded the ‘Best Vice Chancellor of the Year in Nigeria’ by the Association of Vice Chancellors in 2014 coupled with African Woman Hall of Fame award commemorating the UN International Day in 2015. “It should be noted that her only flimsy criticism to discredit her intimidating profile to occupy this exalted office as the Commissioner of Education in Ogun State was her unlawful sack as a lecturer at Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU) which she appealed and later commuted to retirement was due to her fast rising profile, and leadership qualities despised by her detractors and agents of feudal pasts,” he said.
