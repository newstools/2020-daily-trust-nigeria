The Federal Government has been urged to rehabilitate Nigerian women who have been subjected to any form of sexual abuse. The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mrs Catriona Liang, who made the call during a lunch organized by the British High Commission in Nigeria and the Nigeria Women in Media Initiative in commemoration of the 2010 International Women’s Day, said, “What we are calling for is for government to work in this situation because women have been subjected to sexual abuse.’’ Mrs Liang said the media had a particular responsibility to give the story around women a success. She lauded the media for changing the narrative by reporting issues of sex abuse which she said in the past, people would probably not share their stories to be reported, adding that many women now speak out. “There is a platform, not just on social media but in the traditional media but of course we need, more, we must never become complacent. We need every single one to be pulled out for the legal process to kick in and for the women to be supported,” she said. The team leader, Nigerian Women in Media, Omolola Oladimeji, said they were there to discuss areas of possible collaboration between her team and the British Commission to see how they can help bridge gender inequality in Nigeria.
