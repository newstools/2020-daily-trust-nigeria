The President, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, Dr. Uche Olowu has urged the federal government to focus on creating an enabling environment supportive of driving a market-oriented economy. Olowu said this recently at the Finance Correspondents’ Association of Nigeria (FICAN) forum where he spoke extensively on the outlook of the economy in 2020. He said creating a level playing field and allowing the markets to participate more in rebuilding the economy would enhance economic growth. Olowu said: “The government must be more market oriented by allowing the private sector to do more because there is no way the public sector can sustain the rebuilding of this economy. We need a level playing field, healthy competition, fairness, transparency, rule of law and the governance procedure so people can plan without surprises. “In doing this, we would be able to get the right required outlook.” Reminiscing on the previous year, he said a lot of investment were made and part of the returns would be reaped this year. Oluwu said: “In 2019, the economy has enjoyed cyclical recovery and consequently there have been insufficient growth drivers. And when there are no sufficient growth drivers you would have imbalanced development. “So being that this was the trend in 2019, there is need for us to confront reality that our growth requires new drivers, which is being espoused in 2020 and development needs to be more inclusive and balanced.” “From my own perspective 2019 was investment led. That is how to jumpstart the economy and the new drivers of the economy should be investment led.” “I support government’s approach of investment-led strategy and people blaming the government for borrowing are not being sincere because borrowing was necessary in growing the economy.”  Non-payment of N800bn subsidy debt causes liquidity gap - Experts Capital market: Any hope for investors under new administration?
