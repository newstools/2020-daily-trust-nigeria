There is disquiet and division in the Lagos State House of Assembly over the suspension of two principal officers and two other members. They were suspended indefinitely through voice votes on Monday for what the House called “gross misconduct and other infractions that were against the rules guiding the House and its operations.” Daily Trust however learnt that the suspension of the lawmakers followed recent car purchase by the House of Assembly for members and principal officers. The suspension was allegedly based on the suspicion that the members leaked the information on the vehicle purchase to the press. The development has caused sharp division in the House with 27 lawmakers signing the letter of suspension read on the floor of the House by the speaker. Eight members did not sign the letter, it was learnt. It was gathered that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has intervened to resolve the matter. Speaking with our correspondent yesterday, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Hon. Tunde Buraimoh, said those who refused to sign must have their own reason. He confirmed that the matter was being resolved at the party level using its internal conflict resolution mechanism. The state APC spokesman, Hon. Seye Oladejo, said the party was already talking to the speaker and other members involved to resolve the matter. “What happened is just a mere disagreement. It also speaks to the fact that despite all the members being APC, they operate with maturity; it speaks to the sophistication of their operation. In no time, everything will be normal,” he said.
