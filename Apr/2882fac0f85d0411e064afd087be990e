The Citizens Against Fake Activists (CAFA) has raised an alarm over the enterprise of fake activists exploiting the current coronavirus outbreak to discredit President Muhammadu Buhari and some top government officials for their personal interest. CAFA says these selfish Nigerians are using fake news as a weapon against the president, misleading the general public into believing that the government is insensitive to the plight of the citizens in this trying period. In a statement signed by Director New Media, Comrade Kabiru Dalla , CAFA described them as “enemies of Nigeria”, who have sworn to sow the seed of discord in the country. “The Citizens Against Fake Activists wish to inform the members of the general public that some disgruntled elements parading themselves as activists are using the occasion of the COVID -19 pandemic as a weapon for the propagation of fake news in Nigeria. “They have indeed focused their attention on President Muhammadu Buhari and other top government functionaries in this critical point of our existence, where various countries of the world are staying united in containing the further spread of the coronavirus pandemic. “These groups of individuals have, by their actions, sworn to malign institutions of government by spreading fake news on the various efforts of government towards protecting the lives of Nigerians from the coronavirus and halting the further spread of the pandemic that has been designated a global emergency by the World Health Organization,” the statement noted. The group warned that it won’t hesitate to publicly identify this group of people and their various news platforms and subsequently drag them to court for instigating violence and upheaval in the country. CAFA, however, urged the Federal Government to maintain the momentum in the fight against the pandemic while also urging Nigerians to be peaceful and law-abiding.
