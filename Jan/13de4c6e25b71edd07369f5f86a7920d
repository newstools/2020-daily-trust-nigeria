The APC Students Forum has cautioned electorates against choosing wrong people in the forthcoming re-run elections in Sokoto State. A statement signed by the Secretary of the Forum, Muhammad Salisu said the coming election was between the retrogressives and progressives. The students, who advised voters to vote people who had been tested and found worthy for representation, declared support for the former federal lawmaker, Bala Hassan Abubakar in the Sokoto-South/Sokoto-north federal constituency rerun. Abubakar was sacked by the Court of Appeal, sitting in Sokoto which directed for a rerun election. According to the students, the ex-lawmaker made a lasting impression by touching the lives of his constituents. “He is one politician that truly differs from others in all ramifications. He consistently bankrolls the payment of school fees to over 3,857 indigent students of his constituency, gives our District Heads  motorcycles to ease their mobility and renovates and equips many Primary schools,” they said. They added that the sacked lawmaker did not only assist the people of Magajin Rafi B and  Gagi A&B to protect their transformer from vandals but also constructed  and renovated borehole facilities to provide potable water to people.
