The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has issued guidelines to all local and foreign airlines on special flight to Nigeria on humanitarian grounds on how their crew can have access to Nigerian cities to rest prior to their flight time. The NCAA circular dated 3rd April 2020 titled “Update on clarification on flight restriction into Nigeria due to Covid-19 pandemic” and signed by its Director-General, Capt. Musa Nuhu, was addressed to all Nigerian operators and foreign operators flying into Nigeria. The circular said further to our letter on restriction of international flights into Nigeria, we wish to inform you that the following crew rest protocols have been developed to accommodate crew operating evacuation flights of more than 6 hours: It stated: “All applications for evacuation flights shall made to through appropriate embassies; all operators must provide prior notification to Port Health crew arrivals and departure/repatriation to ensure screening at point of entry; and “Port Health will be responsible for screening at POE while NCDC is responsible for screening and monitoring during the period of rest if necessary” it said. The NCAA said these protocols must be strictly adhered to. It would be recalled that all foreign flights into Nigeria had been suspended till April 23, 2020 for the first instance.
