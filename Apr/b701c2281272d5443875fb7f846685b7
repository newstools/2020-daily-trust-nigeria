The outbreak of COVID-19  will not cripple the N4 billion flyover project at Customs roundabout, Maiduguri metropolis. The Borno State Commissioner for Works, Arc. Yerima Saleh, gave this assurance while conducting newsmen round the project site yesterday in Maiduguri. “COVID-19 is raging across the globe and causing the suspension or stoppage of programmes and projects in many countries will not affect the execution of this flyover contract. “It is an 18-month contract, the execution of which started four months ago, to be completed in June 2021 and it has been made categorically clear to the contractors that there will not be an extension of time. “So the contractors are not even asking for any extension of time, which is not even being contemplated, and we are not experiencing any challenge in the execution of the contract,” the commissioner said. Arc Saleh said the state government would not trifle with the flyover, which is both the terminus and take-off point of the roads linking Nigeria with the Central and East African countries. The principal trans-border roads  from the Maiduguri Customs roundabout are: Maiduguri-Dikwa-Gamboru-Cameroon-Chad as well as Maiduguri-Bama-Banki-Cameroon-CAR. The Commissioner said already N110 million had been paid as compensation to people whose properties were affected by the  project, adding, “there may still be some outstanding, but nobody is complaining about the project.” Commuters, residents groan under Port Harcourt traffic gridlock Flying over Maiduguri’s traffic congestion LASG approves flyover for Ajah, Abule-Egba
