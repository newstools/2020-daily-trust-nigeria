Lawyers who filed applications for review of the Supreme Court judgments in Imo and Zamfara states have insisted on pursuing the matter. The lawyers in the matter said they have completed service of processes as ordered by the Supreme Court on February 18 and are continuing with it. Robert Clarke (SAN) confirmed to Daily Trust yesterday that he will be continuing with the application tomorrow. A member of the Imo team also stated that they are still on the matter. “We are on it,” she said. Also, a counsel in the matter said services of processes of the court have been completed as of Friday which would pave way for the hearing of the applications. This is despite the decision of the Supreme Court which on Wednesday dismissed the application by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governor-elect, David Lyon for review of the Bayelsa governorship judgement. Two senior lawyers were fined N60m for filing the review application. In the Imo application brought by their counsel, Kanu Agabi (SAN), PDP and Emeka Ihedioha are asking the apex court to review its judgment of January 14 which ruled that Hope Uzodinma and the APC proved that results from 388 polling units of the state were unlawfully excluded from the total collated votes, and that they polled 213,495 votes. In the Zamfara application, the APC faction believed to be aligned to former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, is asking the Supreme Court to review its consequential judgment of May 25, 2019 which declared votes polled by the APC as wasted votes and ordered the swearing of the party with the highest lawful votes (PDP) as winners of the election Why S/Court’s hearing on Imo, Zamfara applications stalled S/Court: Bayelsa ruling sends signal to other applications Anxiety in Imo, Zamfara as S/Court hears gov’ship applications today
