S&P Global Ratings agency has downgraded Nigeria into ‘junk’ territory to B-, following the drop in crude oil prices. The latest rating took a number of sovereign rating cuts on oil-exporting nations, including Mexico, Angola, Ecuador and Oman, though the major cause of the oil slump, Saudi Arabia and Russia, were both spared. Mexico was lowered to BBB, leaving it just two cuts from junk; Colombia is now just one step away, while Angola and Ecuador were both chopped into the CCC default danger zone. S&P Global Ratings agency said in a summary of its action that “We have lowered the ratings or assigned a negative outlook on some sovereigns because of their heightened risk to manage the fiscal and external shock, resulting from lower (oil) prices in addition to the blow to economic growth as a result of the pandemic.” Crude oil prices have dropped more than 60% this year as the combination of an oil market battle between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the global Coronavirus pandemic. S&P also slashed its Brent oil prices assumptions for the year to $30 a barrel as part of its move. It warned last month that a drop to an average of $40 could leave the Middle East region’s average sovereign rating just one notch above ‘junk’ by 2040.
