The House of Representatives says it has no enough money to perform its primary functions. The spokesman of the house, Benjamin Kalu, said this in Abuja weekend while addressing journalists on the complaint of lack of funds by some committees. Daily Trust reports that National Assembly is yet to make the details of its N128bn 2020 budget known to Nigerians. The budget covers salaries and allowances of the 109 senators and 360 House of Representatives members and their aides as well as the National Assembly Service Commission and the National Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies. The spokesman of the House of Representatives said the leadership of the parliament was struggling to manage its responsibilities with the available resources. “We opened it up so that people will understand what we do in the House of Representatives. The activities are much and funds are small. Many people would not like to hear this. And this is the truth. “We are not talking about the constituency projects and all that. Let’s focus on making laws, oversight function and the rest. The money is not enough. So, if any committee says, we are struggling, it is not because the leadership doesn’t want to give money. It is just that they’re trying to manage what they have,” he said. He said despite the hue about the monies being allocated to the National Assembly, it still operated the same budget template used 10 years ago. “Go and check the records. The budget was the same type 10 years ago. Look at the purchasing power of our currency 10 years ago and then weigh it with what it’ll be able to do,” he added. Kalu, however, noted that despite the paucity of funds, the house had been able to achieve a lot through its committees working day and night to ensure the smooth running of MDAs and curb corruption.
