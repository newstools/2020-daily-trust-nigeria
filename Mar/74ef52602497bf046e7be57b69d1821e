Hundreds of members of some political parties deregistered by the Independent National Electoral commission (INEC) have indicated interest to join the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Yobe. Alhaji Umar Kukuri, the state Chairman of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), disclosed this in an interview in Damaturu, the Yobe state capital. Kukuri said the Gov. Mai Mala Buni administration in the state had attracted many members of other political parties to the APC. “The Buni administration has accommodated opinions of individual politicians, policies and programmes of most opposition parties thereby making the movement much easier. “While some are still contemplating on where to go, most of the members have decided to go with the APC,” he said. Kukuri urged the political parties to accommodate new members, saying “you should give the new members a sense of belonging for democracy to thrive in Nigeria”.
