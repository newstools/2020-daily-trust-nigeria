For the first time in about two decades, the Nigerian Government on Monday launched its first licensing round for marginal oilfields in the country. The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) disclosed this in a statement posted on its Twitter handle. The Department stated: “A total of 57 fields located on land, swamp and shallow offshore terrains are on offer.” It would be recalled that the Federal Government had revoked 11marginal fields’ licences, including the Ororo field, OML 95, and the Dawes Island Marginal Oil Field, formerly called OML 54 licenses in April this year.
