The National Centre for Remote Sensing (NCRS) has explained that the severe cold witnessed in parts of northern Nigeria was partly connected to climate change and other phenomena such as jet streams and harmattan wind. Head of Unit, Hydrology and Climate (Water Resources) at the National Centre for Remote Sensing, Onoja Desmond in an interview with Daily Trust said while weather remains unpredictable, the drop in temperature was partly due to climate change which he said cuts across all weather elements. Desmond said temperatures would likely drop further in the coming years, exposing residents to colder weather conditions unless the issues of climate change are checked globally. He explained that Jet streams which are rapidly moving air at the upper level of the atmosphere as well as the northeast trade wind, otherwise referred to as harmattan with the altitude of Jos, the Plateau State capital has made the city the coldest in the country.
