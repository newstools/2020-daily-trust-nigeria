The Senate has advocated public-private partnership as an alternative means to funding road infrastructure in the country. The Chairman, Senate Committee on Works, Adamu Aliero, made the call when his committee paid a courtesy call on Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje. Aliero said the partnership had become imperative in view of large number of roads rehabilitation in the country, adding that there is no way the government can fund over 522 roads within a year. The lawmaker said the purpose of the visit to Kano was to inspect all the ongoing Federal Government projects being handled by the Federal Ministry of Works. He explained: “In particular, we singled out one important road project, the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano road because it is a project that enjoys funding from the annual budget, Sovereign Wealth Investment Authority Fund and the Abacha Loot. “We are not happy with what we have seen: we made it very clear to the contractor that we will summon the Managing Director of Julius Berger. Work is going on a very slow speed. We didn’t see enough equipment and men  at site. This is very unusual of Julius Berger. “The safety regulations are not strictly adhered to. Management of the highway at the end of reconstruction was not properly done and has led to series of death. We are not happy with this,” the Senator said. In his remarks, the state governor noted that lack of rail system had caused great problem to Nigerian roads, saying that unless there is proper planning, government would continue to waste funds. According to him, even though it is absolutely necessary to repair the roads, that is not the lasting solution but the lasting solution is to develop the railway system so that heavy vehicles will be reduced.
