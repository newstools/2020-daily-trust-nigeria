Tuesday’s anniversary marks the actual date of the queen’s birth, while further events normally take place in June to mark her official birthday. Born in 1926, the queen ascended to the throne in 1952, when she was 25 years old. In 2015, her reign surpassed that of Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother, who occupied the throne for six decades from 1837 to 1901. Britain’s system of constitutional monarchy keeps the queen as a largely ceremonial head of state, allowing the government to pass legislation and run the country.
