The ravaging Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has caused a slump in international air traffic to Nigeria, with foreign carriers cutting flights by 20 percent. The President of the National Association of Nigerian Travel Agents (NANTA), Mr. Bankole Bernard, said the effect of COVID-19, especially to travel, could not be quantified. He stated this in Lagos while briefing newsmen on the forthcoming NANTA elective Annual General Meeting (AGM) taking place in Kano from March 26 to 27, 2020, with the theme:  “National Carrier: A Remedy to Sustainable Tourism Development and Revenue Generation”. Bankole, however, said despite the slump, ticket sales still continued as Nigerians tried to change their trading patterns by going to Turkey instead of China where the virus started from. He said, “Yes; there has been a decline in traffic, but we see Nigerians changing their movement. If Nigeria operates the open skies approach, some of the international carriers will apply to fly two or three aircraft into Nigeria because Nigeria is doing all it can to curtail the spread of the virus. “None of the foreign airlines that flies into Nigeria has cancelled its flight since the spread of the virus. We are still selling tickets; although not as much as we used to.” He, however, said the COVID-19 outbreak did not affect local flights. On the AGM, he said the gathering of drivers in the aviation sector downstream would explore how government’s tax policies affected the travel industry and how the potentials in the sector could be galvanised to generate employment.
