National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has condemned the persecution of chieftains of his party in Zamfara State. Speaking when he received a delegation of the state APC in Abuja led by a former governor, Abdulaziz Yari, he said steps were being taken to address the persecution. “As you have seen, today you can be the ruling party, tomorrow you may become an opposition party. The rule of engagement must allow everyone regardless of political party affiliation to express himself, associate freely, enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of movement. “I am happy however that in spite of the repression and misuse of law enforcement agents to arraign and detain people unjustly, that your spirit has not been detained. “I’m one who believes that you can jail my flesh but you cannot jail my party’s spirit and once I’m committed to a cause, I will fight it to the conclusion. I want to thank you for maintaining the peace and order in the state and not taking the laws into your hands,” he said. Earlier, the state APC Chairman, Lawal Liman, said the PDP-led government in the state was persecuting their members. Meanwhile, former governor of the state Abdulaziz Yari has debunked the allegation levelled against him by APGA gubernatorial candidate Alhaji Sani Shinkafi that he was fomenting crisis in the state. Shinkafi had petitioned the Inspector General of Police, DSS and the presidency demanding Yari’s arrest over allegation of inflammatory statement. Yari threatened to seek legal redress.
