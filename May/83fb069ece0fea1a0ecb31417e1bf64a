The National President of Miners Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Kabir Muhammad Kankara has asked the Osun State Government to release the foreign illegal miners arrested to the Federal Government for prosecution. Kankara said Nigerians cannot fold their hands and allow foreigners go out with their mineral resources. The foreign illegal miners, comprising 17 Chinese and 10 locals including a traditional ruler, were alleged to be mining gold in the state without the required documents, but claimed to have been permitted by a monarch. Kankara said: “We demand that the Chinese be released to the Federal government for prosecution because this is a Federal government affair. The solid mineral is under the exclusive right of the Federal Government. We as association of miners demand that the state government should hand them over to the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development for prosecution.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
