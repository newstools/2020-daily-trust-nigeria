 The Secretariat of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) has been shut after one of the senior executive members of the council contracted coronavirus. A source, who spoke to our reporter, on Wednesday, said the affected official had earlier reported herself to a hospital, where her samples were taken after noticing some symptoms relating to the COVID-19. City News gathered that the result came out positive on Tuesday and the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu Candido, directed that the secretariat be closed. Meanwhile, executives of the council and others who had contact with her have been ordered to go into isolation for 14 days, the source further stated. The Head of Information Department of the council, Mrs Patience Olaloye, confirmed the report but said the secretariat was only partially shut.
