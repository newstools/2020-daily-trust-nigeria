An e-learning platform in Nigeria, EduTech has launched its student financing solution named EduCollect. The education financing gateway aggregates funders to provide loans to students of various academic institutions. Created for both students and guardians, the product facilitates secure loans to allow students to continue with their studies without the added pressure of bulk or upfront payments. The General Manager of EduTech, Femi Shonubi, explained that as a pioneer in the education financing space in Nigeria, EduCollect will provide unparalleled access to short-term loans with a convenient repayment regime at some of the lowest interest rates in the market without any collateral. “EduCollect provides access to educational loans without collateral and relatively low-interest rates. It also allows students to secure educational loans, to enable them to have access to quality education.” He noted that interested students can secure their education via EduCollect by following three simple steps it outlined. Shonubi also said his firm has reduced the cost of bandwidth to support students’ online connectivity, adding that the online programme was also able to eliminate challenges of hostel accommodation for campus students and the challenges of transportation for off-campus students. This is because they could have virtual online studies with their lecturers from the comfort of their homes. He also said EduTech has advanced with the induction of graduates of its Bachelor of Nursing Science programme with the Obafemi Awolowo University Centre for Distance Learning (OAU CDL), with two of the graduates bagging first-class degrees.
