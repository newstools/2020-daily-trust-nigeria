The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will create more Polling Units (PUs) across the country before the 2023 general elections. This is coming six years after its botched attempt to create 30,027 additional units. Chairman of the commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said this yesterday in Abuja, when he received Geographic Information System (GIS) support equipment donated by the European Centre for Electoral Support (ECEC). INEC had in August 2014 proposed to create additional 30,027 PUs, with the northern region getting 21,615, while the southern region was to get 8, 412 units. This led to uproar forcing INEC to jettison the plan. But Yakubu at the ceremony, while appreciating the support of the development partners, said the equipment would assist the commission in the area of delimitation of constituencies which is one of its constitutional responsibilities. 2023: INEC to create new polling units â€”Yakubu INEC approves 150,000 polling units for 2015 polls 2015: INEC urged to suspend new polling units till after elections
