The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Adamu Mustapha, has called for peace and unity among the stakeholders and executives of the ruling All progressive Congress (APC) in the area. Mustapha made the call during a stakeholders meeting of the party in Gwagwalada on Saturday, which had the party’s ward chairmen in attendance. He said no party would survive in the absence of unity, warning that, “If we allow divisive factors and personal ambitions to override our collective existence, then we should be ready for surprises.” The chairman maintained that he had no reason to allow the party on which ticket he became chairman to fail, while promising that he would handover to an APC candidate at the end of his tenure. The APC Chairman in Gwagwalada, Alhaji Ahmed Baba, assured the chairman on behalf of APC executives, of unflinching support for the administration.
