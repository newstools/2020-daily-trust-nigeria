Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has told its customers across Kano, Katsina and Jigawa states that uninterrupted power supply will be guaranteed if they pay their electricity bills regularly. In addition, the DisCo said constant electricity  will become a reality if the customers will help to report issues of power theft, illegal connection and meter bypass and other attempts at sabotaging installations. The company gave this assurance in a statement by its spokesman, Ibrahim Sani Shawai , pointing out that with the massive investment in network expansion and efforts of the government in the power sector, the only set back to uninterrupted power supply remains the huge debts that some customers have refused to pay and the threat of energy theft. KEDCO said it was obligated to pay for power transmitted to it by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) without excuse. “If KEDCO buys and distribute, it needs to get back the money from customers to pay back to secure more for subsequent distribution,” it stated. The spokesperson quoted the  Managing Director, Dr. Jamil Isyaku Gwamna, as saying that the company’s “greatest challenge has remain the refusal of some customers to pay bills as well as report issues of vandalism and power theft. “We have the capacity and the network to give uninterrupted power supply as we have been improving but somehow the huge debts have really become an issue that must be addressed to keep our commitment intact to TCN and other stakeholders because we don’t generate power”, he added. Gwamma  explained that the  company was sensitizing the customers on the need for them to partner with the DisCo to collectively guarantee maximum satisfaction.
