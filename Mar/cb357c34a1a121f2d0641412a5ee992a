The House of Representatives yesterday resolved to intervene in the ongoing two-week warning strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities over the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. The house also invited Ministers of Education as well as Labour and Productivity on the issue. This followed a motion of by Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau) who noted that the strike action would cause a lot of academic problems to the University students as well as embarrassment to the nation, “It’s a wrong signal to the world”. He lamented that the situation of public Universities in Nigeria is worrisome considering that many of them don’t have required facilities to teach. He called on the house to invite ASSU for an interaction to understand their reservations with a view to proffer solutions.
