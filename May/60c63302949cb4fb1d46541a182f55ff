Yobe State government yesterday received the second batch of 51 Yobe  Amajirai repatriated  from Nasarawa State due to COVID-19. The Chief of Staff to the Governor, Abdullahi Yusuf Gashu’a, disclosed this to journalists during a media briefing on COVID-19 at government house, Damaturu. The state had earlier received 125 Almajirai from Gombe and isolated them in the same facility which became a source of worry to many residents as some of those deported from Kano to Kaduna were tested positive for coronavirus. According to him, contrary to other state’s decisions, Yobe is not deporting any Almajirai studying in the state.

He said that their activities would rather be regulated as advised by healthcare workers. The SEMA Executive Secretary, Dr Mohammed Goje, who received the Almajirai  said Nasarawa State government has already examined them and presented their medical status to the state. Goje assured the people that SEMA would continue to feed them  and counsel them during their 14-day quarantine before handing them over to their parents. “While ensuring that they are well received, the medical team as well took all vital parameters of each of them, educate them on psychosocial counselling, reviewed the Nasarawa State health reports submitted to them.”  COVID-19: Fear of transmission heightens as govs repatriate almajirai across states Taraba finally accepts Almajirai evacuated from Nasarawa Northern traditional rulers reject repatriation of almajirai
