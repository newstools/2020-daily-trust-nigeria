The Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 2, Ahmed Iliyasu, has assured residents of Lagos and Ogun states that security has been beefed up in both states to curtail the activities of criminals. Iliyasu said that Divisional Police Officers (DPOs), Area Commanders, tactical commanders and the Commissioners of Police in both states were working assiduously to tame the upsurge of crimes in the areas. Speaking with journalists yesterday in Ota, Iliyasu warned that hoodlums caught terrorising residents would face the wrath of the law, saying, there was no place for criminals to hibernate within the zone. Stressing that the coronavirus disease was real and had caused unrest globally, the AIG explained that the position of governments on lockdown was to detect hidden cases of the pandemic and proffer solutions that would get rid the country of the virus. He added, “We are assuring all our people in Lagos and Ogun states that, based on the security architecture, new sets of tactical fusion forces have been deployed. There is patrol and quick response, and we have sent out all the numbers of operatives in the Command, including those of the DPOs and Area Commanders. “I am assuring all the people to go back, disregard  rumours and sleep with their two eyes closed because our officers are fully on ground.” Iliyasu enjoined the residents to be vigilant at all times and report any suspicious individual in their areas to the police, adding that government had put machineries in place to forestall any criminality.
