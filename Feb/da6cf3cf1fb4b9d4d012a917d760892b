The House of Representatives yesterday mandated its Committee on Tertiary Education and Services to investigate disbursements of funds to tertiary institutions by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TEFFund) for infrastructure and other purposes over the years. The committee was directed to identify the core needs and areas in different institutions requiring urgent attention and report back within four weeks. This followed a motion by Emmanuel Ukong-Udo (PDP, Akwa Ibom) who noted that the TeETFund was established in 2011 to improve the funding of institutions and provision of physical and non-tangible infrastructure, improve manpower development and rehabilitation of existing structures to improve leading and research in the institutions. According to him,the condition of tertiary institutions is demeaning as the schools are deteriorating fast. 2019: TETFund disburses N208bn to tertiary institutions â€¦FG provided N727bn infrastructure in higher institutions N/Assembly to create 80 varsities, polys, COEs
