The police in Ondo State are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a police sergeant, Saliu Tolulope, who allegedly shot himself and his wife dead last week in Akungba Akoko, Akoko Southwest local government, Ondo State. The incident was said to have taken place in the presence of their two kids. Tolulope was said to be having an argument with his wife in their apartment when suddenly the neighbours heard gun shots. When the neighbours rushed into the coupleâ€™s apartment, they found them in a pool of blood. The wife was said to be visiting her husband, who was newly posted to the local government area. Sources close to the scene said the argument that led to the death of the couple arose from an accusation of infidelity. The Chairman, Police Community Relations Committee, Akungba division, Prince Rasheed Ajimo, described the incident as tragic and called for proper investigation. The newly appointed Ondo State Police Public Relations Officer, Tee-Leo Ikoro, said full scale investigation had been launched into the incident to ascertain what really led to the deaths.
