The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) yesterday discharged 300 displaced victims of the January 19, 2020 pipeline explosion at Abule-Egba, who had spent six months at its relief camp. The displaced victims were relocated to Igando, along the LASU-Iba expressway, on the order of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. To successfully close the chapter on the accident, LASEMA has commenced the disbursement of financial assistance to victims who were resident at the camp. According to the LASEMA Director-General, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, the financial assistance was a follow-up to the skills acquisition and vocational training programme earlier done for the victims to aid their resettlement. The skills acquisition programme was done in conjunction with the state Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation last month. Oke-Osanyintolu said, “The beneficiaries, having developed marketable skills, are now being provided with funds towards seed finding and rehousing/resettlement in more suitable areas.”
