The 23 suspects are staff of a hotel in Umuguma, Owerri West Local government area of the state,  where the owner, Chief Aguwa Osuagwu,   – who before his death  tested positive to COVID-19  – stayed after returning from abroad. This staff were quarantined while the hotel was sealed. The Imo State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Damaris Osunkwo, said that the 23 persons have been sent to their various homes to continue the process of isolation. Osunkwo, in a statement signed by Obi Okoro, said that after being in isolation for a while, the state government decided to send them home and monitor the process of self-isolation since none of them had shown symptom of the disease.

Earlier the state commissioner for Information, Declan Emelumba, had dispelled insinuations that those who had contact with Osuagwu are positive. Emelumba said that the clarification had become necessary to diffuse anxiety of Imo people over COVID-19 pandemic due to misinformation surrounding the death of Chief Osuagwu.  ‘Osuagwu’s case didn’t expose Imo people to COVID-19 danger’ Coronavirus spreads to Abuja Before testing positive for COVID-19, Kyari mingled with govs, ministers, others
