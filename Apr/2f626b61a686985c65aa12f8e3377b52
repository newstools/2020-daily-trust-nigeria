The Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd) has commended officers and men of the Nigeria Customs Service on essential duties at the borders and ports despite the risks of contacting the coronavirus pandemic amidst the lockdown in parts of the country. Ali was quoted in a statement by the Service’s spokesman, Deputy Comptroller Joseph Attah, as saying that the operatives have been rising to the challenge of their professional calling by keeping the seaports functional. He said: “The continuous rigorous patrol of sea, creeks and land borders are crucial activities needed to sustain national economy and protect Nigerians from criminal elements who may want to take advantage to smuggle in items that will further complicate our health and security.” Reminding the officers and men that this is one of those times when their professional calling as security agents puts them on the line despite the risks, the Customs boss advised them to maintain distancing, regular hand washing and adherence to other measures. The CGC also charged stakeholders involved in cargo clearance at the ports to cooperate and adhere strictly to the preventive measures put in place at the Commands.
