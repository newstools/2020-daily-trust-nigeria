The Acting Secretary of the FCT Health and Human Services Secretariat, Dr. Mohammed Kawu, has been discharged from the Asokoro District Hospital, Abuja, where he has been receiving treatment for COVID 19. Dr. Kawu disclosed this in a statement he personally signed and made available to journalists in Abuja on Saturday moments after he tested negative for the coronavirus. It would be recalled that the Acting Secretary announced that he and some members of his family contracted the disease about two weeks ago. Speaking about his experience as a coronavirus patient, Dr Kawu said he had moderate to severe symptoms. “I developed chest infection,  so I had to be on antibiotics for some days. But thank God, I and members of my family do not have the symptoms anymore and we have been discharged from the isolation centre,” he said. He warned against stigmatizing victims of the disease, saying,  “even me, I was not spared. I heard that people around the neighbourhood where I live were spreading the news in fear. So we need to really work on the stigma issue”.
