The Centre for Africa Liberation and Socio-Economic Rights (CALSER) has warned Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State and other state governors against engaging Chadian soldiers to help fight insurgency as it would be counterproductive. CALSER’s counsel trails Gov. Zulum’s visit to N’Djamena, capital of the Central African nation in January, where he met with Multinational Joint Task Force to discuss security-related issues in Borno. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja on Monday, President, Princess Ajibola, revealed that Chad, like other Francophone neighbours, haven’t demonstrated genuineness of purpose in the war against insurgency. “Consequently, the Centre for Africa Liberation and Socio-Economic Rights wishes to use this medium to call on the governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, to ensure that his actions and inactions as governor of the state are geared towards the restoration of peace in Borno State and its environs. “This became necessary in the light of some of the actions embarked upon by the governor in his quest to bring about peace in Borno State. While this is indeed commendable, it must be stated in unequivocal terms that such actions must be in the best interest of the country and, in conjunction with the security agencies, as anything short of this would be unacceptable and rejected in its entirety,” the group said. The group alleged that Chad has now become a safe haven for fleeing Boko Haram insurgents when they come under heavy bombardment from the Nigerian troops.
