Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. The meeting, a source said, would focus on the swearing-in of Mr Worgu Boms as the replacement for Chief Victor Giadom as National Deputy Secretary, by South South National Vice Chairman, Prince Hilliard Eta. The APC had been thrown into leadership crisis since last week, following the suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiohmole as National Chairman and the endorsement of Giadom as Acting National Chairman for two weeks by a court. However, majority of the NWC members appointed the ailing Deputy National Chairman, South, Sen Abiola Ajimobi, as Acting National Chairman.
