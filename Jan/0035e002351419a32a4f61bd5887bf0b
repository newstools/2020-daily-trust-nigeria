The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) on Thursday asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to immediately release Senator Shehu Sani from detention. In a statement on Thursday by Yinka Olomojobi, SERAP accused the anti-graft agency of violating both the national and international law for detaining the Senator. “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) should immediately release activist, Senator Shehu Sani detained on allegations of extortion or charge him with a recognizable criminal offence. “By prolonging his detention without charge or trial, Mr Sani is being treated like a convicted criminal, in violation of national and international law. According to Mr Olomojobi, “The right to personal liberty is one of the most central human rights as it is connected to the essentialist rudiments of an individual’s physical freedom. “The right therefore protects the individual against the excesses of the government and its agents. “This right is juxtaposed with other human rights and can be formally traced back to the English Magna Carta of 1215. Mr Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th Assembly, was arrested on the 31 of December 2019, for alleged extortion of $20,000 (N7.2m), from the owner of ASD Motors, Sani Dauda.
