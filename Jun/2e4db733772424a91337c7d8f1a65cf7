The FCT Ministerial Task Force on Environmental Sanitation has continued to crack down on one of Abujaâ€™s biggest drug colonies on the mountain overlooking the Apo Roundabout. Speaking to journalists after raiding and razing down the shacks of the suspected drug peddlers, which sprawl the foothills of the Apo mountain ranges, Chairman of the taskforce, Comrade Ikharo Attah, said the exercise was the second in a week. Comrade Attah stressed that the cleaning exercise was sanctioned by the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, and that it was intended to clear the Oladipo Diya Junction to Apo Roundabout corridor of anything that constituted nuisance or was an eyesore to members of the public. Attah who lamented that each time the raids were carried out, the suspected peddlers escaped, said the exercise would be sustained in order to achieve the set objective of making the capital city a clean and safe environment for all citizens. City News learnt that two persons were arrested over suspicion of dealing in drugs while tonnes of dried leaves suspected to be cannabis (Indian hemp) and bottles of codeine were recovered from some of the shanties.
