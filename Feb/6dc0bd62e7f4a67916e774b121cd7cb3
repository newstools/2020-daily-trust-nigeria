The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has called for the resignation of Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of All Progressive Congress. Wike, in a statement issued in Port Harcourt on Saturday by his Special Adviser on Electronic Media, Simeon Nwakaudu said his call for Oshiomhole’s resignation is as a result of his failure to stop the inauguration of Bayelsa State Governor as he allegedly boasted. He said: “This is a country where you see people who do not have character. Today they sing a song, tomorrow they sing another song. I think Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress PC is not a character that anybody should associate with.” Ortom to Oshiomhole: Differentiate between a party chairman and labour leader Edo crisis:  APC dying under Oshiomhole-Idahosa Oshiomhole should resign from APC - Nwafor
