Justice S.B. Na-Malam of the Kano State High Court has granted the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, leave to file a motion seeking judicial review of the preliminary report issued by the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission (PCACC) asking for his suspension pending investigations into allegations of financial misappropriation. The court said because the case was transferred from Court One, it has to be started afresh, saying one of the two ex-parte applications filed by the emir on January 21, 2020 was an abuse of court process as it was a duplication of the earlier one filed on June 6, 2019. Justice Na-Mallam said while he disregarded the second application, he has considered the first one and granted same. By this ruling, the emir has satisfied the requirement of seeking leave and has obtained the leave, thereby making his case ripe for hearing at the next adjourned date. Meanwhile, the court has restrained the PCACC from proceeding with its investigations against the emir pending when the substantive matter would have been heard. The case was adjourned to March 10, 2020 for hearing of the motion on notice. In a similar development, the case filed by Alhaji Munir Sanusi (Danburam) and four others, where they wanted the court to declare PCACC incompetent to investigate the emir, could not proceed as one of the defendants in the matter was not ready. The case was adjourned to April 8, 2020 for the hearing to continue.
