A Grade One Area Court, Karu, convicted one Cletus Ayuba, 24, who was arraigned by the police on burglary charges. The defendant, who resides at Baba Bala, Nyanya, pleaded guilty to the four count charges proffered against him. The prosecution counsel, Adeyanju Ayotunde, had told the court that the defendant trespassed and broke into the complainantâ€™s church, Christ Eternal King International, Abuja. Ayotunde said Ayuba stole two wall clocks, cooking pots, wireless microphone set of cymbal drum stick and flyer from the church. The defendant was therefore convicted on criminal trespass, house breaking, mischief and theft charges which contravened section 342, 346, 327 and 288 of the Penal Code Law. The Judge, Ismail Abdullahi, convicted the defendant and adjourned to March 2, 2020 for sentencing.
