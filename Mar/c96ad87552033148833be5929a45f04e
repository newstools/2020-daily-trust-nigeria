The speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, says Nigeria is at war against those wishing to remake her world in service of a discredited theocracy. Speaking yesterday in Abuja at a workshop on International Humanitarian Laws organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross, he said this war would not end on the battlefield as insurgencies rarely do. According to him, the war “will end when through the combination of superior military might, diplomacy and steady improvements in quality of life for the people on the ground, we force the enemy to run out of steam.” B/Haram using drones to monitor troops’ operations - Borno gov The need for caution on Syria 100 years after First World War
