Four suspected members of a cult gang, the Aiye confraternity, that the police arrested in Ikorodu, Lagos, for alleged violent attacks in the area recently, have admitted attacking rival cult members to avenge an attack on their members. The suspects are Anuolapo Mogaji, 26; Samson Isaac, 30; Tobi Daniel, 21; and Adesanya Ganiu 20. The police said they arrested the suspects on July 21, 2020, at Igbogbo, in Ikorodu, a Lagos environ. According to the Lagos State Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, Daniel said a childhood friend had introduced him to the gang. “I never knew I was being inducted into a secret cult gang when I joined. I was told we were going to attend a girlfriend’s birthday party. It was not until we got to the venue that I got to know what was happening. I knew it would be daring to turn back at that stage and that was why I went ahead with the initiation ceremony. “We were many young boys. There were lots to drink and smoke at the venue. There were girls also. The girls were willing to do the bidding of the leaders. After the invitation ceremony, I started enjoying their company. I felt powerful and people around me who knew where I belonged feared me. “We go about minding our business. But we avenge any attack on a member. We see it as a delibrate attempt to undermine us. In such a situation, we attack rivals violently,” he allegedly said. Elkana told our correspondent yesterday that the Igbogbo Police Division had received information at about 9pm on July 21, 2020 that some armed cultists had been seen converging on the Igbogbo area of Ikorodu planning to attack and maim rival cult groups at Ikorodu. He said upon receipt of the information, operatives from the Igbogbo Division and the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Ipakodo, jointly mobilized to the area and arrested the four suspects. “They confessed to be members of the Aiye confraternity terrorizing residents of Ikorodu and its environs,” he said.
