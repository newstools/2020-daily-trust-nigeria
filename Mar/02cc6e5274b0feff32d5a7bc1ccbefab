Workers in the Federal Capital Territory Water Board have threatened to embark on strike should the government fail to meet their demands. The workers, under the umbrella of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporation, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services (AUPCTRE), also threatened to cut off water supply to homes. The AUPCTRE, gave the government three weeks’ notice to respond to their demand. Addressing journalists during a protest at the FCT water board office, Area 3, Abuja, Comrade Aliyu Maradu, who is the Chairman of AUPCTRE FCT, stated that their demands were that; Engr. Aliyu Ahmed Nahuce, the General Manager of the FCT Water board be suspended from office. He alleged that Nahuce has an established case of fraud, and he is before Justice Charles Agbaza of FCT High Court 11. “When he clears his name, he can come back to the office because nobody is allowed to supervise or preside over government office when he has an established case of fraud and he is before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said. The FCT water board Public Relations Manager, Segun Kayode, confirmed to City News that the matter is in court. “The matter is in court as you are aware and we will wait for the outcome of the court, and what the judge will say,” he said. It would be recalled that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arraigned the General Manager of the FCT Water Board, Engr. Aliyu Ahmed Nahuce, before an FCT High Court over an alleged N275 million fraud.  Workers picket FCT waterboard [video] FCTA and delayed justice Buhari sacks tribunal chairman
