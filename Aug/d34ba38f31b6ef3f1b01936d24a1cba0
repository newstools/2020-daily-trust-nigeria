The new Managing Director and CEO of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading PLC (NBET), Dr. Nnaemeka Ewelukwa, said he was planning strategies to advance the agency. Ewelukwa exclusively told Daily Trust on telephone on Tuesday that he assumed duty as the Bulk Trader’s head on July 25, 2020, a day after the former MD/CEO, Dr. Marilyn Amobi’s tenure elapsed. “I assumed office on July 25. I am still putting together my plans and strategies,” Dr. Ewelukwa said. The Minister of Power, Engr. Sale Mamman, had on June 15, announced the appointment of Dr. Ewelukwa as substantive MD/CEO of NBET. A statement by the minister’s spokesman, Aaron Artimas, said the new appointment was in furtherance of the reorganisation and realignments in the power sector. Until his appointment, Dr. Ewelukwa was the company’s General Counsel and Secretary. Dr. Ewelukwa who has over 20 years of professional experience, has been at the establishment of NBET by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) as a bulk electricity trader in the nascent electricity market. Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State had on July 1, 2020 lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing Dr Nnaemeka Ewelukwa as the substantive Managing Director of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET). “You couldn’t have appointed a more qualified, competent and reform-minded technocrat for the job.” Ewelukwa heads NBET as Marilyn proceeds on terminal leave Ewelukwa appointed NBET MD, as Marilyn goes on terminal leave NBET: Amobi must handover, Minister of Power insists
