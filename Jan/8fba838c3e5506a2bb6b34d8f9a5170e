Chieftains of the PDP in Edo Central Senatorial District have urged the party to zone the governorship seat to their area ahead of this year’s election in the state. They made the demand yesterday during a caucus meeting of PDP leaders in the area at Uromi Esan Central local government of the state. Daily Trust reports that the demand is coming a week after the Afemai declaration of Edo North PDP, demanded for the position of deputy governor, state party secretary and a member of the Board of Trustees of the party. . Addressing journalists after the meeting, Mr Hilary Ekhoye, said the agenda of the Esan people  is to become the next governor of the state, as the area has not produced governor in the last  22 years. “What we have resolved in that meeting is that Esan must produce the next governor of this state. That is our consensus that is the position of Esan. We are not going for any other position. What we are asking now is that other senatorial districts should join us in our demand because Esan is the home of PDP in Edo state,” he said.
