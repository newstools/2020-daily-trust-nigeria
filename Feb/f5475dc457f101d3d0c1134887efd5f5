Ogun State Security Network Agency and Amotekun Corps Bill yesterday scaled second reading at the State House of Assembly. Majority Leader of the House Yusuf Sherif moved the motion for the second reading of the bill during plenary and was seconded by Sola Adams. Leading the debate, Sherif said that the Amotekun corps would be a community policing agency that would complement the work of other security agencies in the state. He added that the activities of Amotekun would be to curb criminal activities such as kidnapping, robbery, cultism and terrorism. “The agency will also be saddled with the responsibility of rendering prompt assistance to crime victims and I want to plead with members to ensure speedy consideration of the bill,” he said. In his submission, Adeyemi Ademuyiwa supported the establishment of the agency, saying the issue of security needed adequate and prompt attention. Responding, Speaker Olakunle Oluomo said an insurance policy for Amotekun personnel was important and should be added to the bill before its passage. “There should also be rules of engagement before employing anybody into the corps. If you go against it you have violated the law. It should be included in the bill,” he said. Oluomo, however, committed the bill to a newly created special committee tagged ‘Security and Strategy Committee’ for further legislative action.
