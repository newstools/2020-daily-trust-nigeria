The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says it has deployed an application “Customer Express” to track sales and distribution in the oil-and-gas secondary model portal to enable market buy petroleum products online. The move is to minimise human contact in business transactions at the  Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), a downstream subsidiary of NNPC, as a result of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the corporation said in a statement on Wednesday. Some major marketers had already started using the platform, said Kennie Obateru, the corporation’s group general manager in the public affairs division, in the statement. Marketers can also register, validate and revalidate their bulk purchase agreements online within a week on Customer Express, Obateru said.
