The National Chairman of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Engr. Yabagi Y. Sani, has asked the National Assembly to initiate impeachment process against President Muhammadu Buhari over the deteriorating security situation and the poor state of the nation’s economy. Sani, a former presidential candidate of the party, said at a press conference, yesterday, in Abuja that the Buhari administration had failed to deliver on its campaign promises to Nigerians. He said President Buhari’s refusal to appear before the House of Representatives recently to discuss national security issues was a big blow to the nation, adding that it showed the president had no regard for the lives of Nigerians. The ADP helmsman said the party’s presidential ticket was open for all zones to contest.  The National Chairman of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Engr. Yabagi Y.
