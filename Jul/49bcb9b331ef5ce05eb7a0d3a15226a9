An FCT High Court has ordered the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, to provide protection and security to allottees of a Lugbe estate pending the determination of a suit before it. Justice O.C. Agbaza also restrained the defendants from “further trespass, encroachment, demolishing and disturbing the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the plaintiffs of land, properties and interests described in various title documents but not limited to the attached document described as Lugbe Extension 1, Abuja, pending the determination of motion on notice.” The judge further ordered service of court papers on Paul Odili, Paulo Homes Ltd, River Park Estate and the Inspector General of Police. The orders followed an ex parte application brought by Victor Giwa Esq., counsel to Mrs Shuaibu B.A., Collins Chukwuma Anomneze, Hannah Omuya, Rosemary Omuya, Saliu Aliyu, Desmond Maduka Ihejirika and Rita Nduka, who sued on behalf of allotted/owners of plots of land and houses in Lugbe Extension 1 Layout. According to the plaintiffs, the application was filed after Paulo Homes Ltd allegedly began extending its portion of the estate. Reacting to the order, counsel to the estate, Bunmi Biyi Esq, who said he had not been served with the court processes, added that he was not aware of any plans to demolish the estate. “You can’t go to court based on speculation,” he said. The case has been fixed for September 17 for hearing.
