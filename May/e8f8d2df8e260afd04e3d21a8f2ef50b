The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that Nigeria’s portfolio investment may decline by at least $11.4 billion this financial year, as the coronavirus disease continues to take huge toll on the nation’s economy. In the report, the multilateral development institution stated that the nation’s portfolio investment would drop from the $9 billion recorded in 2019 to a deficit of $2.4 billion by the end of 2020. Portfolio investments are in the form of a group of assets, including transactions in equity, securities, such as common stock, and debt securities, such as banknotes, bonds, and debentures.

Unlike, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), foreign investors have a relatively short-term interest in the ownership of these passive investments.
