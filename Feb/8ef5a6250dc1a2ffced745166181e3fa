The Managing Director TTL Group, Dr Onuoha Nnachi, has said investment opportunities will abound in the economic sector if the rail infrastructure in the country is developed and made functional. Nnachi, who convened infrastructure dialogue, at Sheu Yar’Adua Centre, Abuja, to find solutions to its deficit, especially rail in the country,  urged the government to create the enabling environment so that infrastructure could be private sector driven. “At the end of this dialogue opinions will be sorted out and what we look forward to is to generate a policy document or a communique which we will send to the SGF which is the engine room of governance of Nigeria,” he said. Also speaking, a former director general of Bureau for Public Entreprises (BPE), Engr. Emeka Eze, noted there are a lot of challenges militating against private sector participation in infrastructure development in the country. Eze, who said that without infrastructure the quest for economic growth will be a mirage, stressed that the country must implement the rule of law to encourage private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure. He said it is only when rule of law is applied that the phenomenon of failed projects would be curtailed in the country.
