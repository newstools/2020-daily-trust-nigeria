The National Polio Plus Committee of Rotary Club International has given out palliatives to its adopted villages in the FCT to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown. Omotunde Balogun, President of Rotary Club of Abuja Metro, at the event, said now is the right time to give to the less-privileged persons in the 30 communities. Omotunde, who coordinated the distribution, noted that since the confirmation of COVID-19 index case in Nigeria, the club has continued to ensure people got help. A total of 1,000 bags of packs containing poundo yam, garri, sugar, yam flour, beans flour and other condiments were distributed and augmented with three 50 kg bags of rice. Some of the beneficiaries who spoke to Daily Trust said the gesture would go a long way in reducing the severity of hunger in their communities and appreciated Rotary for its commitment towards alleviating the suffering of the masses. Dr Ndaeyo Iwot, Ag. Executive Secretary, FCT Primary Healthcare Development Board, who witnessed the distribution, said he was there to show support to Rotary Club, adding that the effort of FCTA in combating the spread of the new COVID-19 so far is above average. Rotary Club has been at the forefront of the fight against polio in Nigeria and is providing humanitarian assistance to many people across the country.
