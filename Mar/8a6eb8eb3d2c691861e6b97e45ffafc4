Kano State House of Assembly has announced the suspension of five members over last week’s row at the parliament. The lawmakers who were suspended for six months include; Labaran Abdul Madari (APC, Warawa Constituency), Garba Yau Gwarmai (APC, Kunchi/Tsanyawa), Isyaku Ali Danja (PDP, Gezawa), Mohammed Bello (APC, Rimingado/Tofa) and Salisu Ahmed Gwamgwazo (PDP, Kano Municipal). The Speaker, Alhaji Abdulazeez Gafasa, who made the announcement during the assembly’s sitting yesterday, said the members were suspended for what the assembly termed as misconduct and violation of the house’s rules and regulations. “The five members were suspended for violating the rules of the house especially Order IV Sub 4 a, b, d and also disrupted the sittings of the house and prevented proceedings from going on. They behaved violently and even attempted to snatch away the assembly’s mace in a clear attempt to sabotage the house sitting,” he said. It could be recalled that a rowdy session ensued last week when the assembly’s committee saddled with the responsibility to investigate Muhammadu Sanusi II, the then emir of Kano, attempted to submit its report on the floor of the assembly. It was reported that the affected members suspected the committee had recommended for the dethronement of Sanusi, and therefore attempted to prevent the report from being deliberated at the floor of the assembly which resulted to the rowdy session.
