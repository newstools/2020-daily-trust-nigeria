Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in the forthcoming election in Edo State, Dr. Isaiah Osifo, says fielding a candidate facing criminal trial by the APC was a mockery of President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption fight. Recall that Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the governorship candidate of the APC and four others are currently standing trial at the Federal High Court, Benin over an alleged N700m fraud preferred against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The four other defendants in the suit are former Edo State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman Dan Orbih, state PDP chairman Tony Aziegbemi, former Deputy Governor Lucky Imasuen, and Efe Anthony. Addressing journalists, yesterday in Benin, Dr. Osifo said it was a show of shame for the party that prided itself as fighting corruption to have fielded a candidate who was currently standing criminal trial in court over money laundering to the tune of N700m. Responding, the spokesman of Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu campaign organisation, John Mayaki, said, “Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu is an unblemished candidate respected by all. “The case that has been distorted and unfairly tied to Pastor Ize-Iyamu for political reasons has to do with the EFCC investigations,” he added.
