Some Abuja youths have urged the Commissioner of Police in the FCT, Bala Ciroma, to involve them in crime fighting in the territory. The youth group, Abuja Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment Organisation (AOIYEA), said the involvement of youths in the crime fighting strategies would make the policing job easier. “We want police in the FCT to carry youths in communities along in identifying problems of crime and disorderliness that cause breakdown of law and order in the territory,” David said. He said the youths, having accessed the activities of the police in the FCT, observed that there was need for more police outposts and police presence in most Abuja communities so that criminal activities would be brought to the barest minimum. “We have seen that there is complete difference in both community and conventional policing in the FCT, compare to the past. We pray that the FCT is gradually become the safest city in Nigeria. We call on the Commissioner of Police, Adamu Ciroma, to continue the good work which he is doing in the territory,” he said.
