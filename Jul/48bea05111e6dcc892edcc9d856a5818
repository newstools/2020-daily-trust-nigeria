The Ogun State government says it has begun palliative works on the long-abandoned Ojodu Abiodun-Akute road in Ifo Local Government Area of the state. A statement issued yesterday by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Kunle Somorin, said cranes and caterpillars from the Ogun State Public Works Agency (OGPWA) had begun clearing gutters and patching potholes along the 4.65km road. According to Somorin, the government had also committed itself to return to full reconstruction of the road at the end of the rainy season. Somorin quoted the state’s Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Engineer Ade Akinsanya, as giving the promise when he visited workmen on site at the Alagbole end of the road. “This road is a vital road. This road linking us (Ogun State) with Lagos State is part of the linkage this administration is relying on to revitalise the economy in this area. There have been lots of complaints about the road and the governor has directed us to make it motorable in the interim. “There will be a brand new road linking this place to Lagos soon. At the same time, the road coming from Sango to Akute will be done,” he said.
