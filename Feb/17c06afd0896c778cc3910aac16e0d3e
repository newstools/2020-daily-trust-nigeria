A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Asiwaju Rotimi Ajanaku, says the only way to tackle crisis in the 774 local government councils of the country is absolute autonomy for the third tier of government. Ajanaku, who was apparently reacting to the crisis rocking the 33 local governments of the state, following a directive by Governor Seyi Makinde, dissolving the elected LG councils, urged the state government and the sacked chairmen to allow the rule of law to prevail. “The political atmosphere in Nigeria is saturated already, it can’t admit any further pressure or unrest. It is on this premise that I appeal to whoever has the intention to foment trouble, or act as agents to cause crises in the state to have a rethink. “Oyo State is our territory and Ibadan is our home, we can’t afford to fold our arms and allow some individuals to destroy our land which everyone in Nigeria testifies to as the most peaceful and accommodating state in Nigeria,” he said. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan has fixed April 1 to hear an appeal filled by the Oyo State Government challenging a court order not to dissolve the 33 local government chairmen and 35 LCDA. The three-man panel of appeal ,chaired by Justice Jimi Bada granted the application for extension of time. Bada adjourned hearing in the main appeal until April 1.
