A faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State loyal to the party’s gubernatorial candidate in the 2019 election, Senator Buruji Kashamu, has split into two with some executive members backing the Abuja peace agreement reached to end the party’s crisis in the state. Daily Trust reports that Kashamu’s group and the other faction led by former House of Representatives member Ladi Adebutu had been enmeshed in fierce battle for the control of the party structure. While the National Working Committee (NWC) recognised Adebutu’s faction, Kashamu’s group under Engr Bayo Dayo as chairman had a court judgment which declared the Dayo-led executive as authentic. But last week, the two groups met with the National Chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus, in Abuja where they reportedly agreed to sheath their swords. However, Dayo distanced Kashamu’s faction from the peace agreement, saying the secretary of the party, Semiu Sodipo, who was at the Abuja meeting had been suspended. In a swift reaction, however, Sodipo said his suspension would not stand because the chairman “lacks powers to do so.” Ogun PDP: Kashamu's faction splits, as Secretary, others align with NWC I remain PDP governorship candidate in Ogun – Kashamu PDP Crisis: Kashamu faction disowns Secondus peace pact
