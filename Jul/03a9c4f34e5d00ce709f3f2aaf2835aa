A pan Igbo group, Ohaneze Ndigbo, has said with the support of all Nigerians for the justice, fairness and equity, the Southeast should produce the next president of the country in 2023. The South South Coordinator of Ohaneze Youth Wing, Chief Chinedu Arthur-Ugwa, who stated this yesterday in Yenagoa while fielding questions from newsmen, said if an Igbo person is given the opportunity in 2023, it would help in cementing the unity of the country. He said all other geopolitical zones in the country have had the opportunity to produce a president; as such it would be ideal for the Southeast to also be considered in 2023. He said the Southeast region had intellectuals and leaders who could perform maximally for the country. “Come 2023, Nigerian leaders must look inward and see the unity they are preaching because it will be hypocritical to preach one Nigeria and a particular section is denied the right to rule. “That is why I call on all other regions to harmonise and support the Southeast to produce the next president in 2023. The political leaders should listen to the plight of the Southeast to ensure the betterment and unity of Nigeria,” he said.
