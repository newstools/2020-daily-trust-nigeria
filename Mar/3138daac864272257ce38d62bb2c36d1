President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the National Assembly to exempt animal feed from the list of items for payment of the Value Added Tax. Buhari requested this in a communication read at the Senate and the House of Representatives yesterday by  Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila. He asked the legislature to amend the recently approved Finance Bill 2019 to accommodate the exemption, saying the amendment would help to support the implementation of the 2020 budget. His letter read:  “Pursuant to Sections 58 and 59 of Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria1 999 (as amended), I formally request that the Finance Act, 2019 (Amendment) Bill, be considered by the Senate, for passage into law. “This Bill seeks to amend the Finance Act, 2019, as recently passed by the National Assembly” The president noted that animal feeds had been included in the list of basic food items that are exempted from VAT. He said aspects of the existing tax holiday incentive for agriculture should be targeted at small and medium-sized firms investing in primary crop, livestock, forestry and fishing agricultural production.
