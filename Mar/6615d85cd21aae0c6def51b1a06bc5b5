The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) would soon collapse with the return of Adams Oshiomhole as its National Chairman. The PDP, in a statement on Wednesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the ruling party is a fizzling political platform facing “inevitable” extinction. The party lampooned Oshiomhole for his alleged failed attempt to divert public attention from the “rot in his party by blaming the PDP and respected Nigerians for the self-inflicted infighting in the APC, for which he is largely responsible.” “It is therefore instructive for Oshiomhole to note that the PDP is too busy to be interested in the APC or engage itself in any brickbat with a failed political party whose end has come. “APC can no longer beguile Nigerians as they have since come to know that it is nothing but a power-grabbing vehicle designed to fleece our nation and subjugate the citizens. “Mr. Oshiomhole should thus concentrate on his role as the undertaker of the APC until he buries the ashes of his fizzling party and save Nigerians the trauma of suffering which the APC has come to represent, instead of dabbling into the activities of our great party,” the PDP said.
