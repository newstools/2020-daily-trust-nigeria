Pan Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, yesterday faulted the timing of the lockdown announced by President Muhammadu Buhari,  saying people should have been given a few days’ notice to prepare for the shutdown. “While we agree that a lockdown is necessary at this point, it should  not have been done as if we were shutting down a barrack under 24 hours,” the group said in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary,  Yinka Odumakin. The group also picked holes in the president’s broadcast, saying the only thing new in the speech is the lockdown of Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory. Odunakin stated: “Afenifere has taken note of the overdue presidential broadcast on Covid – 19. We honestly cannot fathom why it took so long for such to come as the only thing new in it was locking down FCT, Lagos and Ogun states. “The rest  of the broadcast are about  washing hands and sneezing on elbows  and handkerchiefs which can only stil be useful to the Senator removing his face mask to sneeze for the consumption of his colleagues at this point. “It is a big shame that a rich country like Nigeria has been  badly run over the years and up till the time we issued this that it cannot afford any serious stimulus package for its citizens beyond moratorium for N-power earners. “By the way, we do not understand where the president was asking the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to go and get students to be feeding with School Feeding Programme when all students in the country are at home.” Afenifere faults Buhari's broadcast on COVID-19 Soyinka: Buhari's lockdown order illegal, unconstitutional COVID-19: Why Buhari locked down FCT, Lagos, Ogun
