A man, Abdullahi Sarki, has sought the assistance of a Grade 1 Area Court sitting in Gwagwalada, FCT, in sharing the inherited property of his late father among his family members. Sarki, who resides in Unguwar Gwari in Gwagwalada, and eight other plaintiffs in their writ of summons against Haruna Sarki and seven other defendants, told the court that he and the seven defendants had the same father, who died some years ago. He said their late fatherâ€™s estate has not been determined and shared among them in accordance to Islamic principles, while urging the court to assist in sharing the inherited properties among the legitimate heirs. But counsel to the defendants, Barrister A.Y Zubairu, filed a notice of preliminary objection for abuse of court process. The presiding judge, Alhaji Adamu Isah, adjourned the matter till March 26, 2020, for hearing of the preliminary objection.
