Recently, OGFZA, acting upon a directive of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, served letters on all oil and gas free zones, including SIIFZ, informing them of its readiness to implement the ministerâ€™s directive which empowered the authority to assume full regulatory powers over the zones.
