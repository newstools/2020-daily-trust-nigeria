With the coronavirus pandemic altering socio-economic activities nationwide, and as part of its efforts to mitigate the effect on businesses and taxpayers, the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) has extended the deadline for filing of annual returns for individual taxpayers, including self-employed persons, for two months from April 1 to May 31, 2020. Statutorily, the filing of annual returns expires on March 31st of every fiscal year, and attracts stiff penalties for defaulters. But with the extension announced by LIRS, taxpayers are given a breather. According to the Chairman of LIRS, Mr. Ayodele Subair, the extension is in response to appeals made by taxpayers as well as a policy shift by the agency to assuage the effect of COVID-19 on the taxpayers and residents of Lagos State. The chairman implored taxpayers to access our eTax platform for all tax operations and administration matters, including filing of annual returns from the comfort of their homes and offices by logging on to the eTax platform. He promised taxpayers to provide further updates on business operations and alternative payment platforms of the service through the revenue agency’s website and its various social media handles. Subair therefore appealed to residents of Lagos State to support the government’s efforts by adhering strictly to the COVID-19 safety guidelines as issued by relevant health authorities.
