The Progressive Nigerian People’s Congress (PNPC) has called on Nigerians to rally behind the military in its final push to victory in the war against terrorism. The group passed a vote of confidence on the Service Chiefs. The group gave the charge at a world press conference held in Lagos on Thursday, acknowledging the spate of insecurity and appreciating the efforts of the Nigerian Military. “As a first, we must state in unequivocal terms that the Nigerian Military has been at the forefront of ensuring that the various internal security challenges bedeviling the country are curtailed. This is in addition to the arduous task of preserving the territorial integrity of our country. “We wish to state that the sacrifices of the Nigerian Military in the fight against terrorism has been outstanding and this has elicited commendations from far and near and as such it behooves on well-meaning Nigerians to imbibe a new attitude devoid of sentiments to that of patriotism towards the efforts of the Nigerian Military. It is consequently our considered opinion that such disposition by the generality of Nigerians would spur the Nigerian Military to defeat the terror gangs and their sponsors that have elected to destabilize Nigeria,” the group said. In a statement signed by its President, Desmond Abiona, the group reiterated that some selfish elements are in bed with criminal gangs to perpetuate criminality in parts of the country. The group, however, urged Nigerians to resist these conspirators and show support for the military in its final walk to victory.
