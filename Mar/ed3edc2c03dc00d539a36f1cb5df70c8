The minority caucus of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  in the Senate has called for proper monitoring of the disbursement of federal government palliatives to Nigerians to cushion the effect of the lockdown occasioned by  the coronavirus pandemic. The caucus, in a statement by the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, said though they had expected the presidency to engage the National Assembly more in some of the policy areas that are statutory, but yet have to recognize the fact that these were unusual times that may require quick policy responses. “These are perilous times in the world and indeed an unusual situation for our dear country, so the PDP caucus described as a step in the right direction the President’s broadcast and policy measures, which we believe while being short on prioritizing the poor and vulnerable in our society , nevertheless if properly implemented will keep our people safe from this deadly virus,” the caucus stated.
