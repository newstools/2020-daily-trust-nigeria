What people expected from PDP was a serious difference. No seriousness was put in place by the government,” he stated. He noted that APC came at a time the economy was in recession but was able to put a verifiable and physical project across the state within a year while the PDP government cannot execute a single project in the first year. Reacting to the allegation, the Governor of Adamawa state, Alhaji Umaru Fintiri said APC should not be taking panadol for other people’s headache as the PDP administration has never sold any project the way they did in the previous years. He explained that most of his projects are capital project while others have duration of eighteen months to be completed.
