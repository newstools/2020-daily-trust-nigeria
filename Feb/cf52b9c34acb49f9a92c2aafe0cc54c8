Zamfara State House of Assembly yesterday set up an ad hoc committee to probe a N2bn contract for the construction of a new government house awarded by the immediate past administration of Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar. This was sequel to a matter of public importance raised before the House by the House Leader Faruk Musa Dosara. Dosara told his colleagues that records before the House indicated that the Yari-led administration in the state awarded contract for the construction of a new government house in the state. He claimed that N2bn was expended on the project but that, “the project site cannot be traced.” The motion was jointly seconded by deputy speaker Musa Bawa Musa and Kabiru Magaji Kwatarkwashi. The speaker, Nasiru Mu’azu Magarya, constituted a 7-man panel to investigate the matter and report back in a month. The panel is to be chaired by Deputy Speaker Hon Musa Bawa Musa Yankuzo. Other members are Faruk Musa Dosara, Zaharaddeen M. Sada, Ibrahim Muhammad Na’idda, Yusuf Alhassan Kanoma and Salihu Usman Zurmi. However, vice chairman of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Alhaji Sani Gwamna Mayanchi, said to the best of his knowledge ex-governor Abdulaziz Yari never awarded any contract for the construction of a government house. “Even if that was the case, I think they should look for the contractor and inquire from him why he failed to execute the project despite receiving the contract sum,” he said.
