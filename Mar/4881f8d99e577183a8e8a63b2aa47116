The Supreme Court yesterday reserved ruling in the application for the review of the judgement which disqualified the governorship and other candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State in the 2019 general elections. A five-member panel of justices presided by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, had after listening to the parties announced that a new date would be communicated to the parties. Ex-governor Abdulazeez Yari’s faction of the APC, through its counsel, Robert Clarke (SAN) brought the application seeking a review of the consequential order of the apex court which voided the total votes polled by the APC in the election over issues relating to the party’s primary. Clarke argued that consequential order denied the rights of fair hearing to the APC and benefitted PDP which was not party to the appeal. He said, “We are not challenging the judgement of the court but the consequential orders.” But counsel to the Senator Kabiru Marafa-led faction of the APC, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), asked the court to dismiss the application with punitive costs. Citing the recent cases in Bayelsa and Imo states and Sections 235 and 285 of the Nigerian Constitution 1999, Ozekhome argued that the decision of the Supreme Court is final and cannot be reviewed. Counsel to other members of the APC listed as 141 to 178 defendants, Abdullahi Haruna and counsel to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), T.M. Inuwa (SAN), said they have not filed any process in the matter.
