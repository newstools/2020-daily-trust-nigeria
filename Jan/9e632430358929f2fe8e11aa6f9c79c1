The Lagos State government has stated it would not be taking any action yet on illegal operation by commercial motorcycles and tricycles on restricted routes across the state. The decision followed a four-hour Security Council meeting yesterday chaired by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and attended by all commanders of security agencies in the state. Briefing State House reporters after the meeting, the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, said government’s delayed action against restriction of motorcycles and tricycles was informed by the need to achieve a generally acceptable solution to the menace. Omotoso disclosed that relevant parties and stakeholders had reached out to the government with suggestions and representation that could be adopted to proffer a win-win solution on the matter. The Security Council, the Commissioner said, was considering the suggestions and recommendations submitted to the government before it would come up with definite plans on the ‘okada’ menace. Omotoso stressed that the security of lives of Lagos residents and safety of visitors remained paramount to the government, adding that the ongoing enforcement of the extant traffic laws and restriction of commercial motorcycles to certain routes would continue pending the final decisions of the Security Council.
