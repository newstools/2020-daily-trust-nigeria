The Ogun State government says it has launched a mobile application that would enhance information dissemination among health workers in the state as part of measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, made this known yesterday at a meeting of the emergency operation committee on coronavirus held in Oke- Mosan, Abeokuta. Dr Coker said the android application, christened ‘CommCare’, would serve as a resource for information about case definition. The Commissioner, who disclosed that the application had been rolled out at the Ewekoro Local Government Area to enhance the activities of health workers, said that the mobile device would help health workers at primary health centres to easily do risk assessment before the disease escalates to the local government level. She further revealed that the application would be deployed for use in two other priority areas, namely Ado-Odo/Ota and Ifo local governments, given the volume of industrial activities in those localities. The Commissioner assured that the Prince Dapo Abiodun administration had the capacity to contain the Covid-19 and called on members of the public to remain calm and practise personal hygiene. The Executive Secretary, Ogun State Primary Health Care Development Board, Dr Elijah Ogunsola, commended Dr Coker for coming up with the mobile application to aid health workers “at this crucial moment.” Ogunsola expected all primary health centres to use the mobile application to alert the state of any form of emergency.
