The Market Traders Association of Nigeria (MATAN) has appealed to the federal and state governments to compensate their members whose businesses were affected during the #EndSARS protest in Abuja. The newly elected President of MATAN, Jamilu Abbas, made the appeal at the inauguration ceremony of the new executives of the association in Abuja. Alhaji Abbas said it was a tough time for his members over the unfortunate incident, adding that governors should also compensate traders across the country, noting that paying them adequate compensation for the losses would help their businesses bounce back and in turn boost the economy. He commended the effort of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration for initiating various socio-economic intervention programmes.
