No fewer than 200 elderly people in the Itafaji community of Lagos Island on Wednesday benefited from palliatives containing staple foods, hygiene products and face masks. The United Way Greater Nigeria (UWGN), in partnership with the American Business Council (ABC), gave out the items at a ceremony to commemorate the Day of Action. The Day is an annual day of service where local United Ways, with the support of organizations and individual volunteers, fight for the health, education and financial stability of every person in every community. The Executive Director of the UWGN, Kamil Bakare, said that since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization, with the support of corporate organizations and individuals, had been supporting families and individuals in vulnerable communities in the state. The ABC Chief Executive Officer, Margaret Olele, also said, “We remain committed to supporting the livelihood of persons in challenged communities and collaborating with government to drive economic recovery post-COVID-19 initiatives.” COVID-19: Foundation donates palliatives to women with disabilities in Abuja Group, Belgian Embassy mark Refugees Day in Abuja Lockdown: When palliatives don’t reach proletariat
