The Post Master-General of the Federation and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Postal Services, Dr Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, says poverty alleviation is very cardinal to President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. He said this in Abuja on Monday while receiving the Bangladesh High Commissioner to Nigeria, Shameem Ahsan. According to Adewusi, as a huge black nation, Nigeria’s place in the global scheme of things requires that the people be helped to overcome poverty entirely. Adewusi said this was why the present administration was embarking on many “courageous” reforms. He noted that the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy was working hard to compliment the president’s vision of poverty alleviation through the promotion of digital economy, saying NIPOST has a crucial role to play in that regard. Earlier, Ahsan had invited Adewusi to the first centenary of the birthof the Father of the Nation, Mujibur Rahman, which he said his country would be celebrating in March.
