The Senate yesterday inaugurated a 17-member ad-hoc committee to restructure, review and reorganise the country’s security system. It had, last week, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency on security owing to worsening insecurity. The committee, chaired by Senate Leader Yahayah Abdullahi, is mandated to interface with all security agencies to fashion way out of the security challenges and report back in two weeks. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, while inaugurating the committee said respect for the rule of law, transparency, accountability and public trust must be adhered to in order to ensure that the provision of security is underpinned by democratic values.
