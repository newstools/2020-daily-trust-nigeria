As the 1441 Hijra (2020) Ramadan draws to an end, the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, led by its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III, has urged Muslims across the country to look for the moon of Shawwal on Friday. NSCIA Deputy Secretary-General Prof. Salisu Shehu, said this in a statement yesterday. According to him, following the advice of the National Moon Sighting Committee, Friday, 22nd of May, 2020, which is equivalent to 29th of Ramadan, 1441 AH is the first day to look for the crescent of Shawwal, 1441 AH. “However, on that day, the moon will set few minutes before the sun which makes the sighting of the crescent practically impossible. Nonetheless, the President-General, in compliance with the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad, enjoins the Nigerian Muslim Ummah to search for the crescent of Shawwal 1441 AH immediately after sunset on Friday, 22nd May, 2020 equivalent to 29th Ramadan, 1441 AH.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
