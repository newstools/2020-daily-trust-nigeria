The Nigerian Shippers Council (NCS) has reiterated its commitment to fostering the ease of doing business at the nation’s seaports through measures that will make the environment more conducive to all operators. The Council’s Director, Consumer Affairs Department, Chief Cajetan Agu, gave the assurance when he visited the newly appointed Assistant Inspector General, (AIG) Marine Command, Muhammad Uba Kura. A statement quoted Agu as also seizing the opportunity to enlighten the new AIG about NSC’s activities as the regulator of the nation’s seaports. Agu highlighted the Council’s roles in ensuring ease of doing business in the maritime industry, some of which include freight forwarders rate negotiation, recovering monies from imposed charges and enforcement. In his remarks, Kura assured NSC of the full support of the Nigerian Police Force. He said the Nigerian Police was positioned to fight and reduce, to the barest minimum, criminal activities and deal with miscreants, who make the mistake of operating anywhere within the coverage area of the Marine Command.
