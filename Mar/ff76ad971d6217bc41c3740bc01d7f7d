The Secretary to the Katsina State Government, Alhaji Mustafa Inuwa, has said that the State Government under Gov. Aminu Masari will carry everybody along irrespective of party affiliation or geo-political entity. Inuwa stated this when he received the Executives of the state chapter of Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) in his office in Katsina. He congratulated the executives of the committee for finding time to visit him as well as their readiness to partner with the state government. He advised the body to always come forward to offer advice that would improve the wellbeing of the people. “We need everyone’s support and cooperation to enable us to succeed; we also want you to clarify any issue that you are in doubt of, especially on government policies and programmes. “It is morally wrong to post information to social media on an issue that did not occur or happen. “This kind of information usually makes people apprehensive and always have wrong perception of things,’’ the SGS said. Earlier, the IPAC Chairman, Alhaj Ibrahim Saude, stated that they were in the SGS’s Office for partnership with the state government on how they can move the state to the greatest height. Saude disclosed that after the recent de-registration of political parties from 74 to 18, 12 political parties in the state met and inaugurated its chapter where they emerged as executives. The Chairman pledged that IPAC would always support the policies and programmes of the state government, and that they would also point out where the government went wrong.
