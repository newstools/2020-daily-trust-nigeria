A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State, Dr Cairo Ojougboh, says the country will be great despite its current challenges because its economy is in the right direction. He said this at the weekend in Abuja after he was inducted into the Northern Youth Council Hall of Fame and honoured as “Garkuwan Matasan Arewa Najeriya” (meaning defender of Nigerian youths) by the council. The current Executive Director of Project, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), said: “Make no mistake about it, this country is a great country and it will grow, the teething problems we are having currently are not forever, it is a phase. “We must build this country because we do not have another one. We must speak the truth always because truth will always persist and rule over lies.” Ojougboh, while noting that corruption was the major problem of the country, said it was unfortunate that some youths tend to be more corrupt than the older generation, a narrative he said must be changed. The chairman of NDDC Contracts Verification Committee, who said the embezzlement of public funds was seizing the common wealth of the people, stressed the need for all Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption fight. Ojougboh, who spoke on the NDDC operations, said President Buhari was the first president of the country that had not made any demand on the commission, adding that past presidents usually inundate the commission with demands. Malam Abdulmalik Alfa, Director Legal Affairs of the Northern Youth Council, had earlier said that Ojougboh was honoured because of his exemplary leadership style.
