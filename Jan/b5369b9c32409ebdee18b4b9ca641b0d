Ajiya, stated this while fielding questions from our correspondent immediately after he received Niger State Commissioner for Education, Hajiya Hannatu Jibrin-Salihu in his office. He noted that the hubs will be basically meant for training of teachers and pupils particularly at the grassroots, and out-of-school children. Daily Trust reports that no fewer than 200 teachers from Niger State were trained last year by the institute, with a view to acquainting them with digital skills. “In each of the geo-political zone, very soon, NCC will be sponsoring creation of Innovation hubs where we can use those hubs as much as possible to harness needed talents. “Very soon, we are going to start talent leadership trainings, where we are going teach out-of-school pupils and see how to harness their talents, how to become next Bill Gates”, he said. He, however, urged teachers at various levels to improve their knowledge in digital technology, adding that state governments should also queue into the various trainings being sponsored by NCC at the institute.
