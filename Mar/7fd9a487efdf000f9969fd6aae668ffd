The Oba of Benin, Ewuare 11 has said that he has not ordered that people should not sweep their homes for three days in order to avert the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. A statement yesterday in Benin by the Secretary, Benin Traditional Council (BTC), Mr. Frank Irabor, made available to journalists described the rumour as untrue, false and not a directive from the Oba of Benin. Irabor explained that Benin is known for its constant beauty and that before any government started precautionary measures to control the spread of the disease, the traditional ruler had made special sacrifices of appeasement to protect Edo people from the virus. “Omo N’Oba had long ago also advised the people to practice the simple hygienic rules of regular washing of hands with water and soap and use of sanitisers, covering the mouth with handkerchief or serviette or coughing into the elbow, as well as staying at home and reporting any suspected illness to the nearest health facility. “The palace also warns that those peddling the spurious rumour on social media should desist from such acts otherwise, they will incur the wrath of God’s and our ancestors.” 2019: Resist money politics, Buhari tells traditional rulers 2015: Bogus oracle at work again in Benin!
