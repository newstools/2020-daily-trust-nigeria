The Federal Government has warned that it will henceforth revoke any approved mining license that has not been utilised for several years. The Zonal Director, Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, South-South Zone, Engr. Abdulkadir Adamu, disclosed at a one-day stakeholders meeting with the theme “Mineral Resources and Environmental Management Committee.” According to him, the era of approving licenses for a mining site and left unutilised for years is over as government would no longer condole such attitude. He noted that non-utilisation of mining sites by those who have been granted license was responsible for illegal mining sites in the country. He explained that every mining operator must have an expert who must guide all activities on the site to curtail disasters. Engr. Adamu however warned community heads and youth leaders to stop issuing passes to illegal miners as they are mortgaging the future of their communities and the nation for a token. The chairman, Edo State chapter, Mineral Resources and Environmental Committee, Mr. Daniel Ineh, said the meeting would help in sorting out areas of conflicts and forge greater cooperation to enhance national development. He noted that the focus of the federal government was to ensure order in the sector, lamenting that some still prefer to operate informally and without legal authority.
