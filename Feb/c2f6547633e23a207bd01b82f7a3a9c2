The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has been urged to consider adopting community policing to address insecurity in the territory. Abuja youths under the auspices of the Abuja Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment Organisation (AOIYEO), who made this plea, said community policing would help in arresting the excesses of kidnappers, robbers and other hoodlums in the territory. The president of the indigenous group, Isaac David, who commended the minister for setting up a committee to look into insecurity in the FCT, said decisive action was needed in fighting crimes in the territory. “The FCT that used to be the safest place in Nigeria has become a citadel of crimes and criminality. People can no longer move around freely because of fear of kidnappers or killers. This development should be seriously looked into and put to an end,” he said.
