Last February, the Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, put national demand for PMS at 38.2 million daily. The Department, in its National Stock Report, stated that as February 25, 2020, the cumulative stock of PMS at depots across the country was 915.772 million litres, dropping by 3.15 per cent from 945.6 million litres recorded a day earlier.
