Members of the Nigerian Armed Forces would henceforth be given priority services in all MTN Nigeria offices nationwide, the Chief Operating Officer, MTN Nigeria, Mazen Mroue has said. “Walk into any of our offices nationwide, show your Army ID card, and you will be given priority attention from now on,” he said. He disclosed this on Thursday at the media unveil of the company’s thematic media campaign for year 2020 tagged: “Turn it up.” “Turn it up is our philosophical message to Nigerians, that you can maximise the gifts, potentials within you to take yourself to that next level. “We truly believe in the potentials of our people. There’s more in Nigeria than leaving the country,” Mroue said. The MTN boss also revealed that “more than 1,000 rural locations will be turned up for MTN services this year.” Also speaking at the event, Esther Akinnukawe, Chief Human Resources Officer, MTN Nigeria, said: “MTN is inviting you to turn up whatever lies within you. We’re inviting you; we’re speaking to you: ‘What’s it within you that you can do to turn things up.’ Within you is a lots of potential that if you turned it up, you will become greater and be more fulfilling.”  MTN launches #TurnItUpNaija campaign MTN paid Nigerian government over N1.7tr as taxes – COO 5G: The past, the future
