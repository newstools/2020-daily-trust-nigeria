The Managing Director of Kaduna Electric, Engr. Garba Haruna, is seeking the support of the judicial arm of government in the fight against all forms of energy theft and vandalism. He said stringent sentencing by judges and magistrates will help in sending a strong signal to perpetrators that such acts carry severe consequences and will no longer be tolerated. Engr. Garba disclosed this when he led a delegation of the management of the company on a courtesy visit to the Chief Judge of Kaduna State, Justice Mohammed Lawal, in his office in Kaduna on Wednesday. A statement from the spokesman, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, said the company will soon organise a workshop for judicial officers comprising judges, magistrates and prosecutors to enlighten them about various issues in the power sector. The MD also solicited the support of the judiciary in ensuring that customers who have defaulted in the payment of their bills or were caught stealing energy are not allowed to find recourse in the courts where they get injunctions to evade justice. Garba said going by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission’s Customer Redress Mechanism guidelines, aggrieved customers are expected to first seek redress at the commission’s forum offices located in all Kaduna Electric’s franchise states before heading to court. In his response, Justice Lawal thanked the delegation for the visit and promised to support the company within the ambit of the law.
