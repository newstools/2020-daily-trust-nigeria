The structure of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may get weakened in the South-South before 2023 if it continues to sideline its support groups in the region, the Coordinator, APC Presidential Support Committee (APCPSC), Mr. Elijah Ettah and Secretary, Hossana Abel, have warned. Addressing a press conference in Abuja yesterday, Ettah said, “Without the support group, the APC will become weak in 2023, therefore the party must carry its stakeholders along, especially as they have been with the APC all along.” The committee dismissed allegations of award of contract for supply of personnel protective equipment (PPE) for the nine states of the Niger Delta to combat COVID-19. It also said President Muhammadu Buhari was the target of a N5.47bn medical equipment contract allegation against the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).

They added that the office of the director of projects of the NDDC which had been zoned to Rivers State should be implemented and named the Rivers State chairman of the APC support group, Engr. Eneye Jack, for the position. The group also demanded the inclusion of the South-south Zonal Coordinator of the Presidential Support Committee, Hon. Doris Uboh, on the Board of the NDDC. 2023 is upstaging 2019 Lesson from the Kogi and Bayelsa Elections Why I defected to APC – Uduaghan
