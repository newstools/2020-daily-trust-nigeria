Stallion Empowerment Initiative, the philanthropic arm of Stallion Group, has pledged to supply locally produced rice and fish to hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 for the next three months. This gesture would cut across local governments of all states across Nigeria as part of its contribution to cushion the impact of the shutdown. CEO of Stallion Group, Anant Badjatya, said the group has  further committed one staff bus each for the five Government run COVID-19 hospitals in Lagos. The Group will also provide drivers and fuel for the buses, saying the “arrangement will help ensure safer and comfortable transportation of our health care workers who are in the frontline in this fight against the virus.” Chairman Stallion Group, Mr. Sunil Vaswani, said: “These are exceptionally difficult times and urgent emergency resources have to be deployed to cope with the needs of affected states and support their health care systems. “At Stallion Group, our top priority is the health and safety of our employees, customers and our community. There is nothing greater than the safety of the people of this country and its our responsibility to support the government and the community in this time of need. We are deeply grateful to every health care worker and person who has risked their life to fight this pandemic and will continue to support them.” The group lauded the proactive efforts of the government and all the corporate bodies “that have come forward in this hour of need.” Ministry, Stallion Group lock horns over N17bn rice duties Covid-19: We need financial, technical, material support – Buhari Stallion Motors launches Sokoto service centre
