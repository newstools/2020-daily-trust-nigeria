The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN Governor) Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has canvassed a four-point economic recovery strategy for adoption by the Federal Government to enable the country wriggle out of the current COVID-19 constraints and explore the opportunity availed by it for sustainable growth of the economy in  the years ahead. The foremost banker in an article titled ‘How Nigeria can turn the COVID-19 tragedy into an opportunity’, specifically said that economic recovery strategy should focus on four areas, namely, light manufacturing, affordable housing, renewable energy, and cutting-edge research. Emefiele said as soon as the Nigerian economy reopens fully for business after the pandemic, the apex bank will act quickly to enable faster recovery of the economy by targeted measures towards the identified sectors given their employment and wealth creation potential for the country. Noting that currently the gross fixed capital formation in the  nation’s manufacturing is estimated at N24.55 trillion with  machinery and equipment, the main inputs into economic production, valued currently at only N2.61 trillion, the CBN Governor pointed out that in order to pursue a substantial economic renewal, including replacement of at least 25 percent of the existing machinery and equipment for enhanced local production, at least N662 billion worth of investments would be required to acquire hi-tech machinery and equipment. To bridge the equipment gap, he assured that “the CBN will consider an initial intervention of N500 billion over the medium term, specifically targeted at manufacturing firms to procure state-of-the-art machinery and equipment and automated manufacturing models that would fast-track local production and economic rejuvenation, as well as support increased patronage of locally processed products such as cement, steel, iron rods, and doors, amongst several other products.” According to him, the apex bank will also assist the private sector investors in cement production now using enhanced technology and automated manufacturing models by developing a thorough screening process and stringent criteria for equipment types that would qualify for funding under this phase. On job creation, enhanced household incomes and poverty alleviation, the CBN Governor pointed out that in “order to boost job creation, household incomes and economic growth, we will focus our attention on bridging the housing deficit in the country by facilitating government intervention in three critical areas: housing development, mortgage finance, and institutional capacity. “We will pursue the creation of a fund that will target housing construction for developers that provide evidence of profiled off-takers with financial capacity to repay”, Emefiele added. This is even as he unveiled plans by the CBN to support the financing of environmentally friendly energy production, as this has a tangential long-term health benefits over the next three years, as well as look at efforts to drive innovation and research in every sector of the economy. On the way forward for the country,  the CBN governor noted that since after the pandemic the globally system will become radically changed and will require that each country  may continue to look inwards and globalization may be dead for a  generation, as a nation we cannot afford to continue relying on the world for our food, education and healthcare. He said, therefore, that the time had come “to fully transform Nigeria into a modern, sophisticated and inclusive economy that is self-sufficient, rewards the hardworking, protects the poor and vulnerable, and can compete internationally across a range of strategic sectors” In order to achieve this goal, collectively Nigerians and all stakeholders must support the government to build a base of high quality infrastructure; support both smallholder and large scale agriculture production in select staple and cash crops; create an ecosystem of factories, storages, and logistics companies that move raw materials for value-added production and finished goods to markets. Other areas he listed as development imperatives requiring urgent support include the use our fiscal priorities to create a robust educational system; development of a healthcare system that is trusted to keep all Nigerians healthy, facilitation of access to cheap and long-term credit for Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs) and large corporates; development and strengthening pro-poor policies that bring financial services and security to the poor and the vulnerable; and expediting development of venture capitalists for nurturing new ideas and engendering Nigerian businesses to compete globally.
