The Wakeel Muslimeen of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta states, Sheik Iskeel Lawal, yesterday called on the federal government to organise interdenominational prayers with a view to combating the spread of coronavirus. Sheik Lawal spoke yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State, at a one-day workshop for Imams and Dawah workers on protecting the masses against coronavirus. The programme was jointly organised by the League of Imams and Alfas, Ogun State, and the state’s Ministry of Health. Lawal, who urged that special prayers be organised across the country, maintained that there was always a spiritual dimension to fighting any crisis. He also called for a need to step up the sensitisation campaign against the virus at the grassroots in order to save people’s lives. The Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Ogun State governor on Health, Dr Ololade Kehinde, remarked at the occasion that the government recognised the roles of Islamic clerics and Imams to amplify the campaign against the COVID-19 at the grassroots in the state. Dr Kehinde appealed to residents of the state to adhere strictly to all preventive measures and equally avoid unnecessary gathering. The leader of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the event, Dr Wale Famiyesi, applauded the federal and state governments’ efforts at curtailing the spread of COVID-19. Famiyesi, who is the WHO South-south Coordinator, challenged the clerics to always admonish the people at every gathering to be wary of the symptoms of the virus and ensure strict adherence to the precautionary measures.
