The Kwara State Government early today began the physical reclamation of the plot of land bordering the civil service clinic in Ilorin. The reclaiming exercise according to the State Commissioner for Communications, Alhaji Murtala Olanrewaju, in a statement, began in the early hours of Thursday to avoid any needless confrontation. There have been series of protest by aged women who usually meet every Thursdays and Fridays for prayers at the House. Olanrewaju said “Contrary to the claim that the State Government was served court papers on the matter, we state that no court paper has been served as at the time the government took steps to preserve what lawfully belongs to the people. “Finally, we urge the people of the state to remain calm, peaceful, an be guided only by facts of the matter and not be drawn into emotional outburst that is targeted at distracting the public from the issues at stake. “While the administration is focused on restoring sanity to the state after years of barefaced impunity, we will do so within the limit of the law.” After Supreme Court judgement, confusion in Osun town over 27-year-old Obaship tussle PDP reacts to demolition of Saraki's house by Kwara govt Kwara APC, PDP confident of winning at tribunal tomorrow
