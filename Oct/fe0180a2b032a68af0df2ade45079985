Chairman of Nasarawa Eggon Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, Alhaji Danlami Idris Odasko, has said that 120 political appointees are not enough for him. “I have 120 political appointees. “If I have more revenue sources, I will increase their number to 200 or 300. “The political appointees are mostly youths who want a means of subsistence. “Neglecting them would not augur well for their immediate community,” he said. He said aside from the elected councillors, aides are important as they are tools for sensitisation of the masses on government programmes and policies. Odasko said paying the aides between N10,000 and N20,000 monthly was better than spending huge sums of money on the havoc they would cause if they are left idle.
