The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked 10 members of the Imo State House of Assembly elected on its platform who dumped the party for the All Progressives Congress (APC) to vacate their seats or face legal action. The lawmakers defected following the nullification of the election of Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP as governor of Imo State by the Supreme Court. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the defectors risked their seats because there was no premise upon which they left as there was no faction or crisis in the PDP. The party described such action as unpatriotic and an unpardonable betrayal of the people of their respective constituencies who chose and identified with the ideal and visions of the PDP as the platform for their representation at the state assembly. The party said the defectors showed lack of character, failure of leadership capacity in moments of challenges and absence of faith to stand with the people in their most trying moment.
