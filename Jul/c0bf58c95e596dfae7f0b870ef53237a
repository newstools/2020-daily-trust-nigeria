Olam Nigeria Limited, one of the agro-commodity companies in the country, has begun implementing a community awareness campaign on COVID-19 and the distribution of free cooked food to less privileged people, in some selected communities in Kano State. Speaking during the food distribution exercise in Kano, Zonal Manager of the company, Mr. Adamu Bello, said the campaign was designed to address the widespread ignorance among a large segment of the people on the spread of coronavirus, as well as educating them on preventive measures to be adopted in controlling the disease, especially within communities. He explained that the company was implementing the initiative in order to support measures being taken by governments at all levels to tackle the suffering brought about on Nigerians by the pandemic. The food distribution exercise was conducted in Dawanau Market, IDP Camps, Dorayi Karama, Dakata Sauna, Zangon Marikita, Dorawar Naâ€™abba, Danladi Nasidi, Hotoro Kwanar Yashi, and Sheka Aci Lafiya. In her remarks, Kano State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Hajiya Zarau Umar, commended the company for initiating the cooked food distribution programme and urged other entities in the state to emulate the kind gesture.
