He said the operation was sequel to actionable intelligence linking terror and criminal elements in the “super camp” to series of terror-related violence, kidnappings, gun-running, cattle rustling and other heinous crimes across Nigeria. He stated: “Special Operatives of Operation Puff Adder of the Nigeria Police backed by the Special Forces of the Police Air Wing, in a daring offensive operation, stormed one of the largest operational camps of the Ansaru terror group (also housing other bandits and kidnappers) located in Kuduru Forest, Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State and successfully neutralized over 250 high-profile members of the Ansaru Terror group.” Mba said, “Unfortunately, during the operation, a police bell helicopter, which provided aerial and intelligence cover for the ground troops came under attack from the bandits using sophisticated anti-aircraft rifles and GPMG.” “Commendably, the pilot and the co-pilot who demonstrated uncommon courage and expertise successfully landed the aircraft at the Air Force Base, Kaduna without further incident. “They were thereafter evacuated for medical treatment. Both officers who sustained non-life threatening injuries are currently receiving treatment and are in stable condition. The police helicopter has since been flown out of the Kaduna Air Force Base by Police Pilots en-route to Abuja.” Police neutralize over 250 terrorists, bandits in Kuduru forest Many killed as vigilantes, bandits clash in Katsina Police arrest 93 suspected kidnappers
