Maryam Sanda, who was sentenced to death for killing her husband, Bilyaminu Bello, has challenged her conviction and sentencing in a notice of appeal filed at the Court of Appeal in Abuja. She was sentenced to death on January 27 by an FCT High Court after the Justice Yusuf Halilu found her guilty of killing her husband,  a nephew of former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Bello Halliru Muhammad, in 2017. In the notice of appeal filed on her behalf by her team of counsel led by Ricky Tarfa (SAN), Maryam Sanda, said the judge erred in said the judgment of the trial court was completely “a miscarriage of justice.” The first of the 20 grounds of appeal alleged that the judge failed to rule on her preliminary objection challenging the charge preferred against her and the jurisdiction of the court. She said that was evidence of bias against her and a denial of her right to fair hearing as constitutionally guaranteed. The appellant submitted that “the trial judge erred in law when having taken arguments on her preliminary objection to the validity of the charge on the 19th of March, 2018 failed to rule on it at the conclusion of trial or at any other time.” In ground 2, the appellant contended that the trial judge erred and misdirected himself by usurping the role of the police when he assumed the duty of an Investigating Police Officer.
