Lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Tuesday collectively vowed to disappoint some aggrieved Nigerians who allegedly call them a “rubber stamp assembly.” The Chairman, House committee on Media and Public Affairs, Benjamin Okezie Kalu (APC, Abia) disclosed this while addressing journalists at the National Assembly complex. He said that the 9th assembly will disappoint the people who call them a “rubber stamp” assembly as a result of the speedy passage of the 2020 budget and the Finance Bill sent by President Muhammadu Buhari to the lawmakers. He reiterated that the House has set out goals, to be achieved, aimed at brining needed development and transformations to the lives of Nigerians. It would be recalled that some aggrieved Nigerians had raised questions as to the speedy passage of the annual national budget, among others.
