The PDP has hailed the ruling of the Supreme Court upholding the elections of governors Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta and Darius Ishaku of Taraba. The party in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the rulings were a validation of the wishes and aspirations of the people as expressed in the March 2019 governorship elections in the respective states. The party observed that the ruling of the apex court was a victory for democracy and the triumph of the people over forces that allegedly sought to forcefully take over control of their states. “The party therefore urges the governors to continue in their qualitative governance for which the people overwhelmingly re-elected them,” the PDP said.
