President Muhammadu Buhari has advised all warring parties in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to obey the party constitution and respect rule of law, top party sources told Daily Trust yesterday. The position of the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has been under focus after an order by the FCT High Court which ordered him to stop parading himself as the party’s boss. However, Oshiomhole got reprieve after a Federal High Court in Kano ordered that status quo be maintained. The call for an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting had also pitched members of the APC National Working Committee (NWC) against one another. The March 17, 2020 date announced by the APC Deputy National Secretary, Victor Giadom, had been dismissed as illegal by a statement issued by the Acting National Secretary of the party, Arch. Waziri Bulama, National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, and National Legal Adviser, Babatunde Ogala. One of the sources who is a member of the NWC, said, “His (President Buhari’s) intervention is always to advise that we should follow the constitution of the party and due process. He told everybody to do things lawfully and respect the constitution which is the law that governs the management and activities of the party.” Meanwhile, the APC National Vice Chairman, South South, Prince Hilliard Eta, yesterday said that those pushing for the removal of Oshiomhole, are plotting to weaken the party due to their 2023 presidential ambitions. Eta, who said this in Abuja, added that their plan was to move some members to another party where they could pursue their selfish ambitions. He debunked a report in a national daily that the people of the South South had abandoned Oshiomhole. He said Oshiomhole still enjoys the support of the leaders of the zone.
