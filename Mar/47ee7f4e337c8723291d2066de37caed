The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State has selected Paul Chukwuma to replace Chief George Moghalu as the party’s national auditor. The spokesman of the party in the state, Chief Madukaife Okelo, said the caucus of the APC in the state elected Chukwuma to replace Moghalu in Abuja. “It is only the national body that has the right to elect an officer of the national body but given that they have ceded the post to Anambra, the party mandated us to  elect  our choice and forward to the zone and to the national,” he said. He said the choice of the state will be forwarded to the South East executive for approval and transmission to the national body for ratification. He also disclosed that about seven persons contested for the position. APC congratulates Trump APC rules out zoning Anambra gov’ship ticket APC national auditor wants laws against defection
