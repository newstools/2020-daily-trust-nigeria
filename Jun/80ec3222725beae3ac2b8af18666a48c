Two elderly women suspected to be beggars lost their lives after a motorist ran over them in Kubwa, Abuja. The accident happened near an area in Kubwa where people with physical disabilities or elderly assemble to beg. A witness, Habibu Sulaiman, said the motorist, driving a Canter truck, arrived the area from the Kubwa Modern Market axis and while negotiating a junction where the beggars congregated, ran over them. Sulaiman said two women died on the spot, while the third one was taken to the Kubwa General Hospital.
