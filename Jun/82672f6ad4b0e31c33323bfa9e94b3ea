A Federal High Court in Abuja has reaffirmed the powers of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to deregister political parties. Justice Anwuli Chikere, yesterday, held that Section 225(a) of the Nigerian Constitution gave INEC the power to deregister parties that failed to comply with its provisions. Thirty two political parties had approached the court seeking to set aside the decision of INEC to deregister 74 political parties. The affected political parties include the Advanced Congress of Democrats (ACD), Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party (ANDP), All Blending Party (ABP), All Grand Alliance Party AGAP), Better Nigeria Progressive Party (BNPP), Democratic Peoples Congress (PDC), Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and Green Party of Nigeria (GPN).
