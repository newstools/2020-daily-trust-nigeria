The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has suspended all enrolment activities and other ancillary services across Nigeria. The decision was reached in due consideration of the rising number of infected persons in the country as stated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and NIMC’s desire to ensure the safety of all Nigerians coming for enrolment as well as that of its staff, a statement from the commission’s spokesman, Kayode Adegoke, said yesterday. “The closure is to curtail the rampaging coronavirus pandemic by encouraging strict adherence to social distancing and observance of necessary precautions,” the statement said.
