Family planning service providers in Ogun State have lamented the low turnout of women using various contraceptives methods in this period of movement restriction in the state, which has kept many residents at home. Two family planning service providers told journalists in Abeokuta yesterday that the development might lead to population surge in the state after lockdown. According to them, with the high rate of fertility in Nigeria and the low prevalence of the adoption of contraceptives by Nigerians generally, the country should expect a significant increase in the population, as many people were made to stay at home in compliance with the lockdown order as the federal and state governments battle to contain the raging coronavirus disease.
