Leadership crisis is rocking the Ndigbo arm of the APC in Lagos State, our correspondent reports. Former publicity secretary of the APC in the state, Hon. Joe Igbokwe and House of Assembly member for Oshodi-Isolo Constituency 2, Hon. Jude Idimogu, are laying claim to the leadership. Idumogu had proclaimed himself as the apex leader of Ndigbo APC in the state, saying he had been recognised by the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The lawmaker also told his supporters that with his emergence as the Igbo apex leader, the coast had become clear for him to rally other Igbos in the state. But Igbokwe who is the Special Adviser to the governor on Drainage and APC spokesman for 12 years, urged the people to ignore Idumogu, saying he remained the authentic apex leader in Lagos APC. He recalled that in the 2019 elections, the state APC constituted an ad hoc Ndigbo committee to galvanise Igbo voters in the state with him as the number one on the list, while Idimogu who at one time was in the opposition PDP, as the number two. Idimogu, who was first elected under the PDP, it would be recalled, defected from the opposition party to the ruling APC in 2017. Speaking with newsmen yesterday, Igbokwe however said he was not dragging the leadership of Ndigbo with anybody but that it was not true that the governor endorsed the lawmaker.
