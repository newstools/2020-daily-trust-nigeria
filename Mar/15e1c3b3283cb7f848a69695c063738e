The Youth Party of Nigeria (YPN) said yesterday that shutting down Lagos, the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, without immediate palliatives would be counterproductive. It said though the COVID-19 pandemic threatened Nigeria’s socio-economic existence and as such deserves all the efforts and attention, but a complete lockdown of Lagos and Abuja without palliatives would “prove to be counterproductive.” The spokesperson of the party, Ms Ilamosi Ekenimoh, in a statement said the decision would affect many informal workers who depend on daily income to survive. The party said: “65% of Nigeria’s economy is informal, especially in Lagos and these individuals survive on earning a daily income. It is, therefore, a bit insensitive for the government to shut out at least five million people in Lagos without anything to fall back on for those 14 days. “ Coronavirus: Airline operators ask Nigerian govt to issue travel restrictions Copyrights commission faces court action over levy Concession of Lagos, Abuja airport stirs controversy
