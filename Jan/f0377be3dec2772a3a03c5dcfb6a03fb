The Ekiti State High Court has sentenced two middle-aged men, Jamiu Idris and Ganiu Issah, to death by hanging for armed robbery. Justice John Adeyeye yesterday held that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and consequently found the two men guilty as charged. The defendants were said to have been armed with offensive weapons like guns and cutlasses when they carried out the robbery on November 16, 2016 at No. 5, Progress Street, off Poly Road, Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of conspiracy and armed robbery preferred against them. The prosecutor from the Ekiti State Ministry of Justice, Mrs Kemi Ajumobi, told the court that the defendants were armed with guns when they robbed Mr Obanibi Adams of his Toyota Camry car registration number LND 118 EA. Mrs Ajumobi added that the convicts were site labourers working on Mr Adams’ site when they robbed him of his car. The phones of the defendants, which were recovered, made it easy for the police to track and arrest them at Isua-Akoko in Ondo State. The car they had stolen and the two guns they used were recovered from them. The prosecution called four witnesses to prove its case and tendered exhibits that included the two guns, five live cartridges, phones, a car and the convicts’ confessional statements.
