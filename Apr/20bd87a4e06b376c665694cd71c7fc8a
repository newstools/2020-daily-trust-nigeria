Suspected bandits have killed a police inspector and wounded one other at Falwaya along Birnin Gwari-Kaduna highway. The bandits were said to have ambushed the moving police vehicle on Monday evening on their way to Birnin Gwari. It was not clear the number of policemen in the vehicle when they came under attack. A source and a senior member of the local vigilante in the area, Hussaini Imam, told Daily Trust that the late inspector worked with Buruku Divisional Police Station in Chikun Local Government. Some villages in Chikun share boundaries with the troubled Birnin Gwari town and often come under attacks by bandits operating along the route. Hussaini also said the bandits, in the earlier hours of Tuesday, attacked another community close to Udawa town under Chikun along the highway and picked a village head. “After they killed inspector Dantani and injured one of his colleagues on Monday evening, the bandits also came to another community close to Udawa and abducted the village head and killed another person called Lado and abduct five others,” he said. When contacted for confirmation, the State Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, promised to call our reporter back but didn’t do so as of the time of filing the report.
