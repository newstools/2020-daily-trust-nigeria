The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has said that all rural markets across the council must seize to exist in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. Adamu, who spoke during a meeting with elected councillors and political appointees at the council secretariat yesterday, said it has become imperative to ensure total compliance with the presidential directive over the COVID-19 lockdown, especially with the influx of people into the council daily. “Some of the reports reaching us is that some rural markets still operate where people converge to buy and sell goods but the council will not accept that,” he said. He added that the enforcement of the lockdown order has become necessary because the increase in reported cases of coronavirus daily in FCT has formed the basis to call on all residents and councillors to go back to sensitise the people of their wards on the dangers of the virus. The chairman therefore reiterated his administration’s commitment towards ensuring that there was total compliance by residents with the presidential directive. He assured that the council in collaboration with the FCT Administration was making necessary efforts to  provide palliatives to residents of the council.
