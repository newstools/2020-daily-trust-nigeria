President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with members of his extended family and Daura community, following the death of his nephew, Alhaji Mutari Dauda, Malam Mamman Daura’s younger brother. Buhari, in a statement issued yesterday by his media aide, Garba Shehu, asked Allah to forgive his soul and reward his good deeds with aljanna. “Let me on behalf of myself and my family convey to you my deepest sympathy for the loss of Mutari Dauda. Death is inevitable and every soul must taste death one day. What we owe the dead are not tears, because our tears can’t bring them back, but what they deserve are our prayers. “In this regard, my heart and prayers go out to all the family members and the Daura community as a whole over this irreparable loss,” the president said.
