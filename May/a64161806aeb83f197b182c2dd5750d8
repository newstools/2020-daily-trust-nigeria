Zamfara State government said it has increased the Ramadan feeding centres in the state from the traditional 150 to 867 points across the state. The Chairman of the  state’s feeding committee’s publicity sub – committee, Alhaji Malami Aliyu Yandoto, told the Caliphate Trust that the increase  was to provide all local government areas, 147 political wards and even polling units with the meals. He said the increase followed a directive by the state governor that all vulnerable and poor persons should be fed, more especially as the country is in difficult times as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Each feeding point is serving between 80 and 100 persons including women and children every day. Our objective is to ease the hardship being faced by people, especially the weak among us.

This is because traditionally, the feeding programme is being handled by the state ministry of religious affairs but we supervise to make sure that the food is delivered to the designated centres and is of good quality,” he said  Feeding multitudes during Iftar Sokoto Ramadan feeding raises dust ‘Why Zamfara spent N2.7bn on Ramadan gifts’
