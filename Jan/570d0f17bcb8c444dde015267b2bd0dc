The Deputy National Chairman (North) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Suleiman Muhammad Nazif has said that the party would reclaim the presidency and win the majority of northern states in the 2023 polls. Nazif said Nigerians were disappointed with the “grave failure” of the ruling APC in the country, hence the resolve to dislodge the party in the next general elections. He stated this yesterday in a congratulatory message to PDP governors; Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa) Darious Ishaku (Taraba), Senator Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Samuel Ortom (Benue) and Aminu Waziri Tambuwal (Sokoto) who emerged victorious at the just concluded Supreme Court judgements. He said even though the party was allegedly robbed of its many victories in the last polls, it was able to recover some of the states it lost in 2015. The two-time Senator and former member of the House of Representatives assured that the PDP would recapture more states in the north under his leadership come 2023, urging Nigerians to have faith in the party and work for its unity and progress.
