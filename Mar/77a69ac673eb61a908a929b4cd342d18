Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) for intervening in the crisis rocking the party in Edo and other parts of the country. The chairman, Edo State Chapter of the APC, Barr. Anselm Ojezua, stated this while speaking with journalists in Benin. “President Buhari’s intervention saved the party from possible implosion. I give credit to the president and the Progressive Governors Forum for halting a very dangerous situation. The party was moving towards a dangerous situation as all sides had taken very extreme positions and the fear was that the party could implode,” he said. Ojezua explained that the APC opted for a second look at the possibility of reconciliation, especially since a reconciliation committee has been set up but was yet to commence work.
