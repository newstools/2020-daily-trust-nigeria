The FCT Ministerial Committee on Distribution of Palliatives will begin the distribution of palliatives to indigent residents in Abaji Area Council today. Chairman of the distribution committee, Alhaji Idriss Abbas, said after the flag-off in Abaji, the distribution would cover the territory to cushion the hardship experienced by vulnerable groups as a result of the cessation of movement. Idriss made the disclosure when he led members of the committee on a courtesy call to the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, in his office yesterday. He told the council chairman that he was in the council on instruction of the FCT Minster, Muhammad Musa Bello, whom he said directed them to visit and check the level of the council preparedness to flag -off the distribution of the palliatives to residents of the FCT. “So, on the strength of that, there is need for us to come and see how far you have gone on the preparation and whether you have a warehouse where we can keep the items,” he said. According to him, the palliatives comprised of rice and some packaged condiments. “We just have to exercise and respect the social distance rules and the council has to ensure it passes information across to the residents to remain in their homes as those in charge of the distribution will take it to them,” he added. Responding, the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the FCT Administration for providing palliatives to residents of the territory. He noted that the palliatives would go a long way to cushion the hardship residents of the council are facing, saying the distribution of the palliatives would also be a  model for other area councils.
