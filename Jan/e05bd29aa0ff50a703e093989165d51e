The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that it was ecstatic over the Supreme Court’s declaration of Senator Hope Uzodinma as the rightful winner of the 2019 Imo state governorship election. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement issued on Tuesday, called on all stakeholders to come together in support of Senator Uzodinma to ensure the success of its Next Level agenda and to entrench the ruling party in the state and the entire South East. “Even as we are still wondering why we lost Zamfara State at the Supreme Court and how the same court ruled our party out of the electoral race in Rivers State, we have never, as a political party, lost faith in the judiciary. “We salute Senator Hope Uzodinma, our supporters and members for their temperance displayed in the aftermath of the blatant rigging of the Imo governorship election. We chose to focus on the judicial route to reclaim the party’s mandate. We are confident that our other stolen electoral mandates will be restored by the courts,” the statement read. Daily Trust reports that the apex court had on Tuesday annulled the election of Emeka Ihedioha and asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately issue Certificate of Return to Senator Uzodinma.
