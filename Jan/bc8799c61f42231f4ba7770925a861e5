The Federal Government says the speculated plan by the U.S. to add Nigeria to its existing list of visa travel ban countries is ill-conceived. The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, stated this on Monday in London during an interview session with Reuters News Agency. NAN reports that the minister is in London to officially engage with international media and other think tank. “On the issue of the travel ban our position is that it’s still speculative because we are yet to be communicated. When we’re communicated We’ll respond comprehensively. “However, in our view it was not well thought out but based largely on negative narratives spread by naysayers. “Our advice to the U.S. is that it should have rethink on the issue because any travel ban is bound to affect investment and growth in the country and those who will be affected are the most vulnerable people in Nigeria,” he said.
