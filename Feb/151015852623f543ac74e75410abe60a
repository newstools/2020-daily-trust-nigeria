The APC has demanded that a fresh governorship election be conducted in Bayelsa State. Speaking with journalists yesterday in Abuja, the party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Mr Yekini Nabena, said the volte-face commendation of the Supreme Court and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the Bayelsa governorship had exposed the opposition party as a fraudulent and two-faced party. The Bayelsa-born APC chieftain, who urged Nigerians to be wary of “motor park politicians majorly in the opposition PDP”, demanded that the rule of law must be adhered to in the case of the Bayelsa governorship.
