The Nasarawa State Commissioner for Special Duties (Revenue Generation), Alhaji Mohammed Bashir, has said the N3 billion Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) monthly target set by the Governor Abdullahi Sule administration is achievable. Alhaji Bashir who made this known in Lafia, the state capital, said the target was achievable and called on all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the state and other relevant stakeholders to key into the drive to meet the target so as to lessen the dependence on federal allocation. He said, “The N3bn target is achievable in Nasarawa because if you look at our proximity to Abuja; the governor is even making it mildly for us. Nasarawa State can actually get up to N4bn or N5bn monthly because there are so many revenue-generating opportunities in the Nasarawa State-Abuja corridor.” Bashir further said, “Government has a lot of plans for development, but revenues are not being paid at the appropriate channels, thereby resulting in loss of so much money. So we need to have a data to know what actually is happening, who is generating what, what are they doing, how is it been paid and to where. “The government created this ministry with the sole aim that revenues are under one roof and leakages are curtailed so that we can maximise our IGR potentials and meet the monthly target set for the state.” Bashir added that a special task force chaired by himself was in place for enforcement of the requisite laws with regards to revenue generation and to motivate the state Internal Revenue Service to collect all revenues due to the state government appropriately. The commissioner also revealed that the governor was already making frantic effort on assessing royalties for the state for the mining activities taking place in the state, and added that revenue from to sector would help boost the revenue of the state government.
