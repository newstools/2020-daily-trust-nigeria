Governors from the six North-Central states have agreed to collaborate toward ensuring effective community policing to tackle the security challenges within the region and the country. The governors, who converged on Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, at the North-Central Security Summit with other stakeholders also resolved to reinforce and provide improved capacity for the various security apparatus in their respective states in support of the community policing strategy of the federal government. In a communiqué read by Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, the summit enjoined traditional rulers and community leaders to assist the police in selecting community policing officers to be recruited to work within the various communities. It stressed the need for all states within the zone to increase their investment in social intervention programmes to provide legitimate means of livelihood to the youth, especially repentant criminals. Earlier, the IGP said the summit was the fifth in the series as similar ones were held in four geo-political zones geared towards effective integration and implementation of the community policing strategy. The governors included: Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa, Simon Lalong of Plateau, Samuel Ortom of Benue, Yahaya Bello of Kogi, Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq of Kwara and Abubakar Bello of Niger, while the Minister of the FCT, Muhammad Bello, was represented by Adamu Gwari the director of Security.
