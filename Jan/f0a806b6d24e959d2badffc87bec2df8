Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum yesterday laid the foundation for construction of an estate of 500 housing blocks encompassing roads, drainages, school and shopping complex near the state university in Maiduguri. The governor gave the committee, headed by his deputy, Umar Kadafur, six months to complete the estate. The 500 houses would be sited in two places which include a bigger estate of 300 units near the university on Maiduguri-Damaturu-Kano road and 200 units on the Maiduguri-Gubio road. Speaking at the foundation laying ceremony, the governor stressed that the estate is expected to reduce gaps in housing deficit caused by increased population especially in the capital city. There is rise in cost of rent and acquisition of houses, a situation forcing some residents to resort to shanty settlements with attendant environmental hazards at the periphery of the city. “The policy thrust of this administration is the provision of affordable houses for low/middle level income households in urban/rural areas through the implementation of policies and programmes that will ensure sustainable development” Zulum added.
