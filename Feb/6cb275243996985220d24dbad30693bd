The Nigerian Governors Forum has requested more information from the Ministers of Power and Water Resources, Sale Mamman and Suleiman Adamu respectively on the Mambila Hydro Electric Power Project. The NGF, in a communique read by its chairman and governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, after a meeting in Abuja Wednesday night, said a presentation by both ministers would provide “more granular pathway” to what needed to be done. The forum pledged to work with the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning by providing the right institutional arrangements in all states to ensure that each state supports the generation and management of geospatial data after a presentation from the Minister, Zainab Ahmed, on the Geo-Referenced Infrastructure and Demographic Data for Development programme in Nigeria.
