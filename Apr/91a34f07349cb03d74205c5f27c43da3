Women’s rights activists have called for the suspension of the Kogi State Commission for Water Resources, Abdulmumimu Danga, over an alleged assault and rape of a woman in the state. Danga was accused of allegedly assaulting and raping a mother and former beauty queen, Miss Elizabeth Oyeniyi, in his Lokoja residence following a recent Facebook post. Governor Yahaya Bello has ordered an investigation into the matter. In a statement on Friday, women’s rights activists led by Dorothy Njemanze of Dorothy Njemanze Foundation with support from ActionAid Nigeria and Global Affairs Canada, urged Bello to immediately suspend Danga as allowing him to remain in office cabinet might jeopardize the investigation. They also called on the state government to identify the accomplices in the assault on Elizabeth and prosecute them along with the commissioner, and demanded protection of the woman, her family, property and other persons involved in the case. The activists said the woman and her family were being threatened, even as she is undergoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in the commissioner’s hands. The commissioner failed to respond to calls from Daily Trust but in an interview he granted an online platform, he denied the allegations, describing them as a mere publicity stunt. “I cannot do such a thing over a mere Facebook post, my attention was drawn to her post and I called my sister to confirm if they had a hand in it, they denied any knowledge of it and even apologized. Nina too apologized and said that it was an innocent post which was misconstrued,” he said.
