A Lagos lawmaker, Jude Idimogu, has said no amount of opposition can dismantle the political structure of the Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC). The lawmaker, representing Oshodi/Isolo Constituency 2 at the State House of Assembly, spoke during a visit to the palace of the founder and mayor of non-indigenes in Lagos, Chief Ngozi Ibekwe, at the weekend. Idimogu stated that non-indigenes should maximally take advantage of the political space to benefit from the state through active involvement in politics. The leader of Ndigbo in the state also said the people should be encouraged by the fact that even if APC ceases to be in control nationally, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, National Leader of APC would continue to call the shots in Lagos State  politically. He said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had lost its relevance in the state.
