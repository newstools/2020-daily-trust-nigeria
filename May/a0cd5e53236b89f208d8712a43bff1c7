The Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has appointed a retired Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) official, Mr Femi Adeoye, who turned his son away from his home for breaching the interstate lockdown, an ambassador of COVID-19 in the state. Gov Fayemi, who received Mr Adeoye in his office in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, said the man’s  exemplary act was “rare and meritorious.” Fayemi also presented the retired FRSC official with a letter of commendation and appointed him as a member of the State Taskforce on COVID-19. Adeoye, reacting to the honour, pointed out that he did what he did not for the camera but for the safety of everyone in the state. He accepted the offer to be a member of the Task Force, saying he was ready to go the extra mile to justify the confidence reposed in him. The letter partly read: “By, in accordance with existing regulations, denying into your household your son who had travelled from places under federal lockdown against your fatherly advice, you have proven to be a good ambassador of our collective resolve to end this pandemic. “Our government and the good people of Ekiti State are very proud of this chivalrous act of courage and principle, which are the hallmarks of the Ekiti person. You represent the kind of self-discipline, selflessness and sense of collective responsibility that our state and nation need desperately today to progress.”  Coronavirus: Governors back Buhari on lockdown extension COVID-19 exposure: Many govs refuse to self-isolate COVID-19 lockdown: Buhari addresses Nigerians today
