Engr. Ambali Amuda, coordinator Ondo North Professionals in Politics (OPYP) has described the former Deputy Clerk of the National Assembly, Chief Olayide Owolabi Adelami, as the man to beat in the Ondo gubernatorial primary election of the APC. Amuda, in a statement, described Adelami as the best strategic option for all the aggrieved APC members in Ondo State. “Aside from the fact of sound leadership acumen and good name of Adelami, he is also from Owo and has really touched a lot of lives through his philanthropic activities in Ondo State,” he said. Similarly, Amuda assured that the APC primary election will hold contrary to the right of first refusal that is being sought by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, adding that he was confident that Adelami has sufficient insider presence in the Presidency to neutralise any scheme by Akeredolu which may confer undue advantage on him.
