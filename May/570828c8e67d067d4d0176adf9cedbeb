The Muslim Rights Concern has cautioned mosque authorities in Nigeria against the reopening of mosques. MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, gave the warning in a statement yesterday against the backdrop of the reopening of mosques by the Borno, Gombe and Zamfara state governments. “We must be on the side of caution regarding this dangerous virus whose cure has not been found. Muslims should not rush to their graves. We suggest that mosques should remain closed until the Federal Government declares the country safe from the pandemic,” he said. According to him, reopening mosques at this time can be interpreted as withdrawing from the battlefield and leaving the rest of the country to face the fight alone and may also be interpreted as disobedience to Federal Government’s restriction on crowding.
