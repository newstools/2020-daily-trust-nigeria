As the restriction of movement began in Lagos State, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has appealed to security agents to be friendly in enforcing the lockdown order. Sanwo-Olu, at a Security Council meeting on Monday with commanders of security formations in the state, urged security agents to show high professionalism in dealing with erring persons and cautioned that high-handedness may lead to the violation of residents’ human rights. Briefing the media on behalf of the Council after the meeting, the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, assured that the presidential directive would be fully implemented, noting that commanders of each security agency had resolved to comply with the governor’s entreaty. Odumosu pleaded with residents and inter-state commuters to exercise self-compliance with the presidential directive. “The enforcement of the restrictions and all directives will be done with a human face. We want to appeal to members of the public that what matters most is self-compliance. People must try as much as possible to comply with the laid down regulations so that we can collectively defeat the pandemic,” he said. He noted that those who had been exempted from the presidential directive would be allowed to move unhindered at any time of the day during the movement restriction period. “Professionals and government officials on essential duties will be allowed to move freely, although their leadership must obtain clearance from security agencies before sending them out to work,” he said.
