A House of Representatives member for Abuja South Federal constituency, Alhaji Hassan Usman Sokodobo, has disbursed N1.8 million to 300 students to register for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) across his constituency. Sokodabo, while making the disbursement in Gwagwalada, yesterday, said the gesture was to encourage youths in his constituency to embrace education. He further said the gesture was also aimed at fulfilling his campaign promises. He advised the students to use the registration fee for the purpose it was intended and not to buy phones and clothing. He assured the students to remain peaceful, saying efforts were on-going to address the increase in school fees in some tertiary institutions in the territory. Also speaking, the committee chairman of the scholarship scheme, Alhaji Salihu Mohammed Agyana, noted that the programme was in line with the lawmakers campaign promise, which he said was aimed at promoting the dignity of human life through assistance, mentorship and empowerment. He therefore commended the lawmaker for initiating the programme, which he said is a relief to indigent students from the constituency.
