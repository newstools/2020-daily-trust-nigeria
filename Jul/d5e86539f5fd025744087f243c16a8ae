The FCT Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Wobin Ayuba Gora, has warned commercial drivers that they would be severely dealt with if they violate the COVID-19 guidelines in the course of conveying passengers during the Eid -el-Kabir. Gora, while speaking with our reporter in his office on Wednesday in Abuja, said there were specified number of passengers each vehicle is expected to carry, as part of measures to contain the spread of the COVID -19 pandemic. He said a five-seater vehicle was expected to carry only four passengers, just as a high capacity vehicle such as coaster buses and luxury buses would only accommodate 50 per cent of the usual capacity. “It is obvious that some erring drivers, especially commercial drivers may take advantage of the coming Eid – el- Kabir sallah to violate the COVID -19 guidelines for motorists. I want to assure you that any driver that is caught will be sanctioned with the charge of overloading,” he said. He said the sector command would also look out for vehicles without the speed limiting devise, saying “if your vehicle is expected to carry speed limiting device and it is not carrying it, certainly you will also be sanctioned.” Gora further said over 10,000 officers of the sector command would be deployed on major highways, especially exit and entry points of the FCT to control traffic during the Eid -el-kabir festival.
