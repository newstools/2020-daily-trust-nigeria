In line with the federal government’s directive banning large congregations and social gatherings, the two major political parties in the country have announced the shutting down of their secretariats. The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole announced the closure of the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. Briefing journalists yesterday in Abuja, the chairman ordered that all workers of the party should remain in their various homes to look after their immediate families. He said the decision was reached by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. He assured the workers that their salaries would be disbursed to them. “This is just a preventive measure the party has taken by closing down the secretariat for about two weeks so we can manage the situation at hand but if it persists, then we will have to extend the holidays because we need to remain alive to be able to serve the country as a whole and members of the party. “We as APC leaders must be seen to obey the federal government’s orders. It is no longer a secret that we are facing a pandemic all over the world and Nigeria has its own share of the coronavirus although, it is not as bad as other countries but clearly the numbers are increasing as it is said, prevention is better than cure,” he said.
