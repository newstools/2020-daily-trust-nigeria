As part of efforts to fight the spread of COVID-19, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Ebonyi State Chapter, has raised an alarm over unavailability of ventilators saying that the four available in the health system of the state are not sufficient to arrest the deadly virus should it venture into the state. The doctors further called on the state government to provide and equip more isolation centres essentially in the existing three senatorial zones of the state. This was contained in a statement issued by the NMA on Saturday, jointly signed by the State Chairman and the Secretary Dr. John Egede, and Dr. Nwoye Chukwuemeka and made available to Daily Trust. “The effort of the state government is commendable but we continue to remind them that it’s important that the isolation centres are well equipped and made functional before the disease enters Ebonyi state. “Also, the four ventilators are not enough for the state if this epidemic meets us. “Again, provision should be made to possibly expand the isolation centres, equip them, including having new ones in at least each senatorial zone of the state. “This is because the disease is closer to us than we ever imagined, and we should not wait till it enters before taking drastic measures,” the NMA pleaded.
