The Peoples Democratic Party yesterday alleged that the COVID-19 pandemic had exposed “the much-hyped” social intervention programme of the All Progressives Congress led government as a total hoax. The PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged that not even a handful of Nigerians had acknowledged receiving any social panacea from the government despite claims by officials, of having paid out billions of naira as palliatives to individuals and households. “More embarrassing is the duplicitous inclusion of the scandalous school feeding programme as an expenditure line even when schools are closed following the social distancing directives; an alarming development that points to the level of corruption in the APC administration,” the party stated.
