Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has called on its customers to cultivate the habit of giving early warning reportage to prevent disaster in their communities from any faulty electrical equipment. Kano DisCo said it observed the attitudes of some customers who refused to report minor faults until they posed serious danger or led to disaster. The Head, Corporate Communication, Ibrahim Sani Shawai, in a statement yesterday said, “We have trained our engineers who have been stationed for any complaints with regard to issues of faulty transformers and other electrical issues. “This is also to caution against consulting quacks to fix faulty or operating on any KEDCO equipment as well as household installations. This is not acceptable. It is only KEDCO engineers that have the requisite training and right to work on our installations and equipment.” The management further observed that many households prefer calling unqualified technicians who often used sub-standard electrical installations that often result to disaster and accidents.
