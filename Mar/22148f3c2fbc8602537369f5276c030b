In her personal Twitter handle, the minister said; “Dear compatriots, I am glad to inform you that my results came out this afternoon and tested negative to #COVID-19.

I feel well & have been in self-isolation since yesterday evening, because, I was in contact with people who tested positive for Corona Virus. Please stay safe and observe all precautionary measures outlined by @NCDCgov,” she revealed on her Twitter page. While in self-isolation, Aliyu said, “I am busy working and liaising with the six area council chairmen in the territory on prevention and sensitisation of people in the area council and satellite towns. “At the same time actively playing my role in the Presidential Taskforce on #COVID19 representing FCT.
