A former member of the House of Representatives and People Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Ogun State, Ladi Adebutu, has distributed hand sanitiser to more than 10,000 residents in the state. Adebutu told journalists during the distribution exercise yesterday in Abeokuta that the gesture was part of his commitment to ensuring that residents were protected from the coronavirus disease. The PDP governorship aspirant in the 2019 elections called for concerted efforts towards taming COVID-19 in Nigeria and other parts of the world. Adebutu, who was represented by a factional Chairman of the PDP in the state, Sikiru Ogundele, said, “We have distributed 10,000 bottles of hand sanitiser to the good people of Ogun State, as our little contribution to help in curtailing the spread of the dreaded coronavirus in our state’’.  2019: Ladi Adebutu rallies 50,000 canvassers, 250 groups for Atiku in Ogun Ogun guber poll: Ladi Adebutu’s PDP faction adopts APM's Akinlade, signs MoU Coronavirus: Outrage as Reps resolve to shut down for 2 weeks
