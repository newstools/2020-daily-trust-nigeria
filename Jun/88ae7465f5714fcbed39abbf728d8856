The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has disclosed in its Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR) for March, 2020 that it recorded a trading deficit of N9.53 billion for March 2020, down from the N3.95billion surplus posted in February 2020. A statement from the corporation Wednesday said the over 300 per cent decline in March 2020 earnings was primarily due to the huge decrease of 181 per cent in the National Oil Company’s Upstream Subsidiary, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company’s (NPDC) owing to the decline in crude oil prices precipitated by  the Coronavirus-induced global slowdown. The NNPC’s MFOR indicated a total crude oil and gas export sale of $256.19million in March 2020 which decreased by 30.89 per cent, compared to last month’s, adding that of the total sales, crude oil export sales contributed $184.59million (72.05 per cent) of the dollar transactions compared with $281.14million contribution in February, while the export gas sales amounted to $71.60million in the month. March 2019 to March 2020 crude oil and gas transactions indicated that crude oil and gas worth $4.95billion was exported.
