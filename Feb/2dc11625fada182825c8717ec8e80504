A former National Assembly member, Mr. Sunday Karimi, has called on governors and stakeholders of North Central states to begin consultations ahead of the 2023 general elections. He said the region’s stakeholders should reach out to political and opinion leaders in other parts of the country towards attaining the leadership of the country. The two-term member of the House of Representatives told newsmen yesterday in Lokoja that the call has become imperative due to the fact that among the six geopolitical zones of the country, South West, South South and North West have all ruled the country while the North Central remained marginalised in the power equation. According to him, the region has sacrificed and contributed immensely for the unity, peace and stability of democratic governance in the country. He said the zone is blessed with qualified individuals and personalities from every sphere of human endeavour with required capacity and experience to lead the country to greatness. He noted that in the spirit of equity and justice, it would be fair for political parties to give priority to the North Central presidency in their zoning arrangement towards 2023.
