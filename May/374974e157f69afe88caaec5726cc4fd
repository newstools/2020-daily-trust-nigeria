The House of Representatives has resolved to investigate alleged extra-judicial killings being perpetrated by security agents while enforcing COVID-19 lockdown across the country. This was resolved during plenary Tuesday based on a motion of Urgent Public Importance moved by Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC, Abia) and co-sponsored by Dachung Musa Bagos (PDP,Plateau) over the incidences of alleged killings and human rights violations. According to the motion, security agencies, which include the Nigeria Police Force, the military and para-military agencies, are saddled with the responsibility of enforcing compliance with the lockdown within the limits of their rules of engagement to safeguard the human rights of citizens. The Federal and some State Governments had declared a 14-day lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States on March 29, 2020, to stem the spread of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the country.
