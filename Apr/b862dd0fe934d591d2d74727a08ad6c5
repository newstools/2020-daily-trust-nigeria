Suspected bandits have killed two housewives in separate attacks on two communities in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Daily Trust on Sunday learnt yesterday. The attacks on the two communities of Rago in Karewa ward and Zoron Giwa in Sabon Birni ward occurred few days ago, but the news of the incident filtered out yesterday due to communication difficulties. The bandits, according to a source in the community, opened fire on the women at Rago, a few minutes drive after Kerawa. The source, who is a resident of the area said, “The incident happened on Tuesday, but due to lack of telecommunication network in the village, we couldn’t inform the authorities concerned. “The two housewives were from Kerawa but went to a nearby village to sympathise with their bereaved relatives when the bandits killed them at Rago. The commercial motorcycle rider who carried them was, however, able to escape,” he narrated. When contacted, the police public relations officer, Kaduna State command, ASP Mohammed Jalige, said he had not received any report on the attack. “I tried to reach the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in the area but his phone was not reachable. I will send him a text message and wait for his reply,” he said. Last month, bandits killed 51 villagers in Kerawa ward, as well as destroyed houses and food items.
