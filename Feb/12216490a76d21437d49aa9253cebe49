The Vice Chancellor of the University of Abuja, Prof. Abdul- Rasheed Na’Allah, says henceforth, no student will graduate from the instiutution without taking a foreign language course. Addressing journalists, he said part of the strategies adopted by the management to produce global competitive graduates was the introduction of foreign languages. He said: “No student will graduate without offering foreign language, be it Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, German or French. We are doing this because we don’t want them to operate only in Nigeria but to compete globally. We want them to see themselves as global citizens.” According to him, the university has also established an international centre to help students who wants to go abroad have exposure. He said the institution had also introduced entrepreneurship as a compulsory part of the education from 200 to 400 level, saying. “The academic preparation we are making for them is not to pigeonhole them into any particular idea, but to make them people that will create wealth for themselves and the nation,” he added.
