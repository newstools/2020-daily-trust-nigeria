The speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, in his address at the resumed plenary of the house on Tuesday, noted that the people of China enjoy rights and privileges in foreign countries, including Nigeria, as such, the Chinese government should allow others to enjoy same in its country. “Where there are credible cases of discrimination, harassment or rights abuses against our citizens, swift and visible action must be taken by the Chinese authorities to safeguard lives, livelihoods, property and the sense of human dignity of Nigerians and fellow Africans. “Extra-judicial punishments including unlawful evictions or detention of persons of colour under the guise of “quarantine”, are not acceptable,” he warned.
