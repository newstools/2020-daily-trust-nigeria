The Senate has said it was scrutinising the National Social Register being used by the Federal Government for its Conditional Cash Transfer to the poor populations across the country. Chairman, Senate Committee on Special Duties, Senator Yusuf Yusuf, told reporters in Abuja on Monday that the probe was to determine the authenticity of the Social Register and the makeup of those currently benefiting from the programme.
