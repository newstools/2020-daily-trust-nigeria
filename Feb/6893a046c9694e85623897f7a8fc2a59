Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State yesterday urged support groups of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State to work for unity in order to maintain the party’s leadership role in the state. Akeredolu gave the advice in Akure during the inauguration of Aketi Coalition Support Group made up of 27 interest groups canvassing support for the governor. He explained that the groups, if united, would overcome all obstacles that could hinder APC’s success at the poll. “I see all these groups on social media; Facebook, twitter and others. They campaign on my behalf but I usually don’t know who they are, although I see their efforts. “The force in you is too much. By God’s grace, we will overcome all battles without fights. Do it peacefully and without fights, and we will win. I didn’t tell you to do this, but you did. I, am here to thank you all and urge you to work together. If not Aketi, then nobody,” he said. Earlier, Hon. Victor Olabimtan, Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Political Matters, said, “We were not as many as this in 2016, and we won. Our victory is assured. We only need synergy among the various groups to realise our vision of a second term for our governor.” Also speaking, Prof. Olu Aboluwoye, the Chairman of Sunshine Integrity Movement, said the achievements of the governor in Akure was innumerable.
