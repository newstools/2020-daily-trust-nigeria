An Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrate Court on Monday ordered the remand of two men, Abolarin Ayeni, 42, and Oluwaseun Ajayi, 34, facing trial over the alleged killing of two minors. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Abdulhamid Lawal, ordered the detention of the defendants in the Correctional Centre pending legal advice from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. He later adjourned the case to Dec. 23 for further hearing. Earlier, the Police Prosecutor, Mr Caleb Leranmo, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on Oct. 11 at Oye-Ekiti. Leramo said the defendants, on the said date, murdered the two children, a five-year-old girl and seven-year-old boy (names withheld). He explained that the children had been sent by their grandfather to buy provisions at a corner store, but their corpses were later discovered in an abandoned car. Counsel to the defendants, Mr Opeyemi Ogunremi, sought a date of adjournment pending the legal advice from the DPP.
