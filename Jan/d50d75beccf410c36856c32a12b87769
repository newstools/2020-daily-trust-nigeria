The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) said the Mass Transit Train service on the narrow gauge line between Lagos and Ogun states would resume today (Wednesday). The resumption is coming four months after it suspended the operation to allow for smooth construction work on the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge service. Managing Director of the NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, however, confirmed that commercial activities on the narrow gauge will resume on Wednesday. Daily Trust reports that the Iddo-Ijoko train service extending to Apapa was the busiest and most patronized among the corporation’s shuttle routes conveying over 10,000 passengers daily and significant amount of cargoes. The corridor, also services the Lagos-Kano inter-state shuttle, which might commence soon. The MD explained that the NRC used the period of the suspension to fix the coaches and the tracks, saying passengers should expect coaches with new oscillating fans, new upholstery seats, and fresh coat of paint to make them more comfortable. He said: “We used the period of our holiday to work on some of our coaches and we would continue to do this as part of our commitment to see that we make passengers enjoy their trips on the railway.” Okhiria said the corporation has acquired two brand new Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) train from the United States. The two trains would replace the two which are almost in unserviceable condition, he stated. He further disclosed that 20 coaches and locomotives that would be deployed to the Abuja-Kaduna and Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge speed tracks are already at the ports.
