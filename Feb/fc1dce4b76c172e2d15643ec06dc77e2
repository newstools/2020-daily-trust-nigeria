Yusuf Zailani (APC, Igabi constituency) has explained how he emerged as the new Speaker of Kaduna State House of Assembly following the resignation of Alhaji Aminu Shagali, yesterday. Shagali had submitted his resignation letter to the Clerk of the House, Alhaji Bello Zubairu, yesterday morning, citing personal reason for the decision. Our correspondent reports that Shagali resigned to stop his impeachment by his colleagues who were said to have accused him of “ineptitude”. Alhaji Sulaiman Dabo, representing Zaria City, nominated Zailani and was seconded by Bako Kantiok-Emmanuel, representing Zonkwa constituency. Our correspondent reports that no election was conducted during the sitting. Speaking on his emergence, the new speaker explained that it was the unanimous decision of his colleagues to elect him as their leader. The four-time member at the assembly told newsmen shortly after a brief meeting with Governor Nasir el-Rufai at the Sir Kashim Ibrahim House that the state parliament was not in crisis. “I didn’t wrestle with anybody and it’s not as if I contested with anybody that you are asking me how I feel. It was the members that needed a change and they asked me to take over. “We are united as one because there is no crisis in the house and we will be just to the people of the state,” he said. Asked why the former speaker resigned, Zailani simply said, “There was nothing.” UPDATED: Kaduna Assembly appoints new Speaker, Deputy Kolawole replaces Imam as Kogi speaker PRP Assembly candidate concedes defeat, shifts attention to youth empowerment
