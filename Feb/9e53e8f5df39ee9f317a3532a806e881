The management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has restated commitment to ending estimated billing system, while reinforcing the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme in Kano, Jigawa and Katsina states. A statement on the commitment issued by the company’s Head, Corporate Communications, Ibrahim Sani Shawai, indicated the MAP scheme is the way forward to protect not just the customers but also the Discos, particularly in addressing the avalanche of complaints often raised by customers. The management noted that it was imperative to restate the continued position of KEDCO with regard to the MAP scheme and efforts to end estimated billing system to enlighten customers toward partnering with the company by getting their meters at any of KEDCO’s offices. It added that the MAP scheme was a continued process that is on-going in Kano, Jigawa and Katsina States and it has successfully metered thousands of customers. The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of KEDCO, Dr Jamil Isyaku Gwamna, was quoted as saying the issue of estimated billing is an idea that is gradually being done away by KEDCO.
