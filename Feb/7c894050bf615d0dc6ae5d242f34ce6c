The House of Representatives Committee on Reformatory Institutions has said inmates of Nigerian Correctional facilities are still being held in inhuman conditions in violation of the Correctional Act. The Chairman of the committee, Anayo Edwin, in a statement on Monday said there is need to urgently implement the Act to bring the needed reforms aimed at achieving the objectives of Nigerian Correctional Services. He promised that the House will ensure the implementation of the Correctional Act 2019. Daily Trust reports that the Act states that the custodial service shall provide “safe, secure and humane custody for inmates”. He lamented that nothing much is being done to alleviate the sufferings of inmates and reform them accordingly, adding that the Act provides for implementation of reformatory and rehabilitation programme to aid reintegration of inmates back into the society. It could be recalled that the Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS) had last year changed its name to Nigerian Correctional Services as part of reforms to improve its image, while Nigeria Prisons and Reformatories were also renamed Correctional Centers.
