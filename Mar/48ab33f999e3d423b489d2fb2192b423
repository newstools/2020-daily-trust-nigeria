The Lawyers Alert Nigeria has disclosed that 52,000 inmates out of 74,000 prisoners representing 70 percent in Nigeria’s 244 Correctional Centers are awaiting trial and presumed innocent. This was contained in a press statement signed by Director Programmes, Roseline Oghenebrume on behalf of the President of Lawyers Alert, Barrister Rommy Mom and made available to Daily Trust on Monday. Lawyers Alert said the decision of the federal government to decongest the prisons as part of measures to prevent the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in the prison was the right step in the right direction. Oghenebrume noted that the decision by the federal government to let some of the prisoners go on bail is not only legal but just, equitable and fair. According to the statement, “Out of the over 74,000 inmates in Nigerian prisons, over 52,000 are innocent and are awaiting trial, which accounts for over 70% of inmates who are presumed innocent by our constitution.” Oghenebrume further said “Following the resolve of the Federal Government of Nigeria to decongest Correctional Centres in the face of the COVD-19 pandemic, Lawyers Alert will alongside like-minded CSOs, engage the Presidential Committee for the Decongestion of the Correctional Centers, Federal, and State Attorneys General, including Chief Judges and State Governors in ensuring the prompt implementation of this policy.” “Lawyers Alert will monitor the implementation of decongestion of the Correctional Centres as part of measures to prevent outbreak and spread of Coronavirus in prisons in the country.”  Let’s fast-track prison decongestion COVID-19: Decongest custodial centers now, Lawyers Alert tell Govt Experts decry corruption, impunity, lack of accountability in prisons
