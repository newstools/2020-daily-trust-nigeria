The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling APC, Mr Yekini Nabena, says he has taken over the position of Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu on acting capacity pending the time the latter will vacate a court order restraining him from duty. A Sokoto High Court last week restrained the party from appointing or electing “Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu or any member” into its top positions except through a national convention. The APC deputy spokesman, in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja, said he would act pending the time Issa-Onilu would sort out the court matter. Nabena said: “The APC is a law-abiding party and as leaders of the party, we must be seen doing the right thing at all times, including respecting the order of the court. In lieu of this, Malam Onilu has begun the process of vacating the order of the Sokoto High Court restraining him. But pending the time this will be done, I will act in his position. “Unlike the former ruling party, APC has high regard for the judiciary and we must be seen at all times practicing what we preach,” Nabena said. The Bayelsa-born politician, who called for understanding among the APC supporters worldwide, urged the media and other stakeholders to cooperate with him in carrying out the assignment. He assured media representatives of prompt response to enquiries and clarifications while creating mutual understanding between the public and the governing party. Our correspondent said the APC national publicity secretary, Issa-Onilu,  did not pick calls put across to him.
