The Federal Government yesterday called on all parties in the leadership crisis at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, to exercise maximum restraint. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono, made the call in a statement by Deputy Director Press, Ben Bem Goong. He said the government had been ‘apprised of the circumstances’ leading to the directive of the council to the outgoing Vice Chancellor to proceed on leave ahead of his terminal date of 30/04/2020. The statement said that while acknowledging that the directive was within the powers and authority of the council to direct the “vice chancellor to enjoy his accumulated earned leave, the ministry considered it unfortunate that this purely administrative matter has been escalated beyond proportion.” Accordingly, the statement advised all parties to the matter “to exercise restraint in the interest of the university.” Crisis brews at ABU as council asks VC to leave Intrigues as ABU selects new VC tomorrow Governing council dares Gov.
