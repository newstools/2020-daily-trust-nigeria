Michelle Obama, the former U.S. first lady says she’s suffering from “low-grade depression” because of the pandemic, racial injustice and the “hypocrisy” of the Trump administration, the BBC reports. She made the comments during the second episode of her eponymous podcast, for which she was interviewing US journalist Michele Norris. George Floyd a “turning point for real change”, says Obama “These are not, they are not fulfilling times, spiritually “I know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression. “Not just because of the quarantine, but because of the racial strife, and just seeing this administration, watching the hypocrisy of it, day in and day out, is dispiriting.” Michelle says managing “emotional highs and lows” requires “knowing yourself” and “the things that do bring you joy”, adding that she has had difficulties with her exercise routine and sleep. “I’m waking up in the middle of the night because I’m worrying about something or there’s a heaviness.” She adds that it is “exhausting” to be “waking up to yet another story of a black man or a black person somehow being dehumanised, or hurt, or killed, or falsely accused of something. “And it has led to a weight that I haven’t felt in my life, in a while” The former first lady however adds that “schedule is key” to managing these feelings – and that maintaining a routine has become even more important to her in the pandemic.
