With three years to the next gubernatorial race in Katsina State, Director General of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria, Dr Dikko Radda has said his next political moves would be unveiled in due course. Radda, a former chief of staff to Governor Aminu Bello Masari, is among top APC chieftains believed to be gearing up for the 2023 governorship race. Speaking with Daily Trust during one of his empowerment programmes under his Gwagware Foundation, Radda said, “You know 2023 has not come but when it comes you will clearly know my position in the political scene.” According to him, the empowerment packages were apolitical because the beneficiaries cut across various parties and are being done solely to address unemployment across the society.” National policy on MSMEs will promote job creation -Radda Fashion industry will play key role in resurgence of economy — Radda SMEs'' sustenance panacea to unemployment in Nigeria - SMEDAN boss
