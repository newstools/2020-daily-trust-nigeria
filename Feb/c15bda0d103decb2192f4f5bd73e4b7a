A faction of the All Progressives Congress in Zamfara State, loyal to former Senator Kabiru Marafa has berated a former governor of the state, AbdulAziz Yari and members of his camp over their claim that APC members are being victimised by Governor Bello Matawalle. Our correspondent reports that Yari and some members of the party had on Tuesday visited the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole in Abuja, where they accused Matawalle of persecuting their members. The Supreme Court had in May last year nullified elections won by the APC and declared PDP winner of all seats at various levels sequel to continual crisis which arose from congresses and primaries of the APC. But in reaction to Yari’s faction claims, the chairman of Marafa’s camp, Alhaji Surajo Garba Maikatako, in a statement said the claims were aimed at causing confusion in the state. He, however, called on the Chief Bisi Akande-led reconciliatory committee of the APC to find the root cause of the crisis in the party in Zamfara State. The statement added, “The fact is, APC remains divided. Our faction is back to court, challenging the outcome of the party congresses conducted in 2018 and Yari’s faction cannot win election in Zamfara State today.” Zamfara: Marafa's APC faction tackles Yari over persecution claim Marafa/Yari feud threatens APC in Zamfara Zamfara: S/Court sacks APC, as PDP bounces back
