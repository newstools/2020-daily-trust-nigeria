The National Coordinator of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Aspirants Forum, Col. Abdulazeez Yar’Adua (Rtd.), has urged the party’s caretaker committee to address the problems arising from the party’s internal democracy. Col. Yar’Adua told newsmen on Tuesday in Abuja that the crisis rocking the party was as a result of the issues from the primaries in 2018 which were not addressed. He said, “A lot of our members were aggrieved during the primaries in 2018, but because we believe in the ideals of the party, we decided to come together to work for the party’s success during the general elections.” Yar’Adua further said the group would meet with the caretaker committee to register its grievances with a view to addressing them. He added that, “If reconciliation with aggrieved members does not take place, the convention will not take place.” The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ruling  APC, recently, appointed Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State as Chairman Caretaker/Extra-ordinary convention committee of the party. This follows the dissolution of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the pary. It would be recalled that the APC witnessed leadership crisis, following the suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman and the endorsement of Victor Giadom as Acting National Chairman for two weeks by a court. However, majority of the NWC members, loyal to Oshiomhole appointed the ailing Deputy National Chairman, South, Sen. Abiola Ajimobi, as the Acting National Chairman. The National Vice Chairman South South, Hilliard Eta, was subsequently appointed to act on his behalf.
