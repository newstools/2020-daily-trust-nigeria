The police in Lagos say four suspected members of an armed robbery gang confessed to robbing and raping women under the Maza-Maza bridge, off the Mile 2 motor park. The police said they arrested three of the suspects – Azeez Sulaimon, 24; Shakiru Oke, 25, and 25-year-old Yusuf Ganiu – at a hotel in Lagos, with their girlfriends. The fourth suspect is Chima Christopher, 25, who had earlier been arrested. The four men were among suspects that the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, paraded before newsmen on Wednesday at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja. “We attack mostly female passengers who come to board vehicles going to the eastern states. Most of them are traders who come to buy goods in Lagos. Most of them arrive the park at Maza-Maza late at night and are compelled to sleep at the park. “Once in a while, they step out to get something to eat or to urinate. We follow the ones going to urinate quietly to the bushy area and collect their valuables before raping them,” they said. Odumosu said 36 stolen phones were recovered from the suspects. He added that Christopher’s confessional statement led police Investigators’ to the hotel, where the three other suspects were arrested. “The suspects will be charged to court at the end of investigation,” Odumosu said.  ‘I was introduced to car snatching under Mile 2 bridge’ Police recover ammunition hidden in garri bag, arrest woman Godogodo:  End of road for ‘most wanted robber’
