The Deputy National Chairman (North) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Lawal Shuaibu, on Wednesday said Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state remains the rightful flagbearer of the party in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state. He stated this when he arrived the APC Secretariat in Abuja to resume office as one of the National Working Committee members who were suspended by the party chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. He insisted that he was never in any way suspended noting that he accepted the party’s forgiveness in the spirit of reconciliation. Shuaibu, who arrived the party’s secretariat at about 3:30pm, was warmly welcomed by both staffs and friends present.
