Speaking on the sideline of the convocation, the Chairman of the Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU), FCE, Zaria chapter, Comrade Haliru Musa, said love for the college by his members was the secret behind the industrial peace being enjoyed. He said, “We are committed to the progress of this college. However, the council and management still owe our members 13 months PAA. They also owe us seven months promotion arrears of 2018 and three months for 2019. They have not implemented the 2019 promotions. So, it is not true that all our entitlements have been paid.” The highlight of the convocation was the presentation of award of excellence to the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufa’i, the late Dr. Yahaya Hamza (a former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education), Prof. Peter N. Lassa, Sen. Ahmed Makarfi (a former Governor of Kaduna State), Malam Bashir Abubakar Alhaji (a Customs Assistant Comptroller General (ACG) and Muhammad Lawal Barau.
