The Nigerian government has said it would slam precision lockdown on 18 local government areas across the country where 60 per cent of COVID-19 cases have been found. Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, said this on Monday at a news conference after briefing President Muhammadu Buhari at the end of the four-week gradual easing of lockdown. He said the state government and local authorities, where the councils are located, will administer the lockdown. “For the precision lockdown, we have identified 18 local governments out of the 774 local government that are considered to be high burden with this infection and they account for 60 per cent of 24, 077 infections. “The reason for the precision lockdown is to place specific measures that will be administered by state governments and local authorities. “It is not for the federal government, it’s the responsibilities of states and local authorities.” Although, the 18 local government areas were not named on Wednesday, Daily Trust on June 2, published a list of 20 local government areas where the virus spread is prevalent from a report obtained from the NCDC.
