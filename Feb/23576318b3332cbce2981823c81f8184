Governor Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno State, yesterday visited Rann, headquarters of Kala-Balge Local Government Area, remotely located around a border between Nigeria, Cameroon linking Chadian territory, and supervised sharing of N100 million cash to the trapped residents forced to trek long distance for food. The governor, accompanied by a member House of Representatives for Kala-Balge, Bama and Ngala federal constituency, Dr. Zainab Gimba, among others supervised the monetary distribution to the community that have to cover about 10 kilometres to border communities to buy food and other basic needs. The distribution of cash informed by the absence of banking services in the locality was extended to over 10,000 households who were given between N10,000 and N15,000 each as crops they planted last year were destroyed by a herd of 250 elephants sighted by UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) officials from helicopters in December 2019. Farmlands still flooded cannot be cultivated by the residents forcing them to depend on aid transported through humanitarian air services. Rann, largely populated by Shuwa Arabs, is considered Nigeriaâ€™s most severely disadvantaged local government headquarters because despite being 25 years in existence, it remains inaccessible during rainy season due to absence of road and bridges linking it with the rest of Borno State. 200 insurgents killed in Kala Balge by villagers 40,000 Nigerian refugees chased out of Cameroon Borno gov visits Gwoza LG, passes nights across villages
