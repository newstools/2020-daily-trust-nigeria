A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State, Engr. Johnboco Onunkwo, has charged the Anambra State governor, Chief Willie Obiano, to ensure that civil servants’ welfare was given the highest priority in line with global standards. Onunkwo, in a statement, said it was absolutely necessary for the state government to pay adequate attention to the welfare of workers as they resume work after the lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. He said Anambra State workers must be protected from the dreaded coronavirus disease at all cost. Anambra State workers should not be exposed to the risk of contracting the coronavirus as a result of government’s inability to provide protective measures, Onunkwo said.
