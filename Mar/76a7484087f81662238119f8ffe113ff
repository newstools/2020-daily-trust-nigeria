Parents have been urged to ensure their children fulfill their dreams by showing interest in their education. The wife of the Assistant Regional Pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) FCT Region 10, Pastor Mrs Rhoda Ebunolorun Adewuyi, who made the call at the Redeemer’s Day celebration in Abuja, said parents should also observe their children carefully to discover and nurture their talents. “When you are interested in the activities that involve your children, they take the activities seriously. All parents should be involved in all the activities of their children, they should go for Open Days, and they should go for any activity the school is organising,” she said. Pastor Adewuyi, who also supervises all RCCG schools in the region, urged parents to pay attention to the talents of their children and keep supporting them until their dreams are fulfilled. The coordinator of all the RCCG schools in the region and also the principal of the Redeemers Private School, Lugbe, Pastor Mrs Yemi Bello, said the Redeemers Day is an annual program to celebrate the redeemer that is Jesus.
