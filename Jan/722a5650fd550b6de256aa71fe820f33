Katsina State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Salisu Majigiri was yesterday invited by the state police command and Department of State Service (DSS) over alleged plans by the party to take over local government administration following a recent Supreme Court ruling. Majigiri, while confirming the invitation by the security outfits, explained that the PDP was not asking it’s dissolved members to forcefully take over their former offices. “We, as law abiding citizens, are confident that the reinstatement of the local government officials would, to a greater extent, reduce the prevailing insecurity, promote economic growth and the general wellbeing of the people. “What I’m telling you is what I told the security agencies that invited me. We only want the government to do the right thing and return our dissolved councils, they will just be there for not more than 15 months to complete their tenure,” he said. The opposition PDP and the APC in the state are at loggerheads over the dissolution of the local councils which case is now before the Supreme Court. The PDP is putting pressure on the state governor to implement a recent Supreme Court judgment on LGAs by reinstating their sacked councils. Recall that Governor Aminu Bello Masari had recently said “The fact that some pronouncements are made somewhere, they don’t directly affect Katsina State unless there is pronouncement from the Supreme Court on our own case.”  Katsina PDP drags Masari to Supreme Court over LG transition committees Sacked LG chairmen: PDP asks Masari to implement Supreme Court judgement PDP: Masari making us more popular
