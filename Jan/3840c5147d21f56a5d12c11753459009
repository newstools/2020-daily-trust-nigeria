An FCT High Court in Kubwa has reaffirmed its earlier order sacking Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Peoples Party as the senator representing Anambra South in the Senate. Justice Bello Kawu, in a ruling on Friday, declined Ubah’s request to set aside the earlier order issued in a judgment delivered by the court on April 11, 2019. The judge had, in the said earlier judgment, sacked Ubah for allegedly submitting a forged National Examination Council certificate to contest the February 23, 2019 senatorial election. The judge had ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Ubah. Justice Kawu had also directed that a fresh one be issued to Dr. Obinna Uzoh of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who came second at the election. Not satisfied, Ubah had subsequently filed an application before the court praying for an order setting aside the judgment. He said he was not served with the court processes or the hearing notice throughout the proceedings leading to the judgment. Pursuant to this, the judge on December 4 granted an order of stay of execution restraining the Senate President from swearing in Uzoh, pending the hearing and determination of Ubah’s application. The judge also ordered all parties to the suit including the INEC to maintain status quo in the meantime. But ruling on Friday, the judge dismissed Ubah’s application for lacking in merit. The judge also dismissed a motion another claimant to the PDP senatorial ticket, Chief Chris Uba, filed to be joined as an interested party in the substantive suit.
