Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo state has signified his intentions to conduct local government elections in the state soon. This is consequent upon his constitution of the Imo State Independent Electoral Commission (ISIEC). Daily Trust reports that the governor on Tuesday forwarded the names of the chairman and members of the commission to the State House of Assembly for screening and approval. The Speaker of the state assembly, Collins Chiji, who read the letter from the governor at Tuesdayâ€™s plenary, disclosed that Mrs. Pauline Onyeka would serve as Chairman while Henry Adimelechi, Ezeukwu, Mrs. Jacinta Uchechukwu and John Ohiri would serve as members. The Speaker immediately inaugurated a screening committee, to be chaired by Authur Egwim representing Ideato North, and appointed some committee members to screen the nominees. Hon. Chiji, however, urged the ad-hoc committee to report back to the House on Thursday.
