Undisclosed number of armed bandits were said to have invaded Madaka and neighbouring communities in the Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State on Wednesday and kidnapped several villagers along with over 100 heads of cattle. The bandits, according to reports, stormed the communities on motorcycles at about 6:30am, shot sporadically into the air, causing the villagers to run for safety, and carried out the operation which lasted several hours without any form of resistance. A source in the area said those kidnapped were mostly middle men being used as shield by the bandits to escape as the operation lasted. “The bandits are heading towards Allawa in Shiroro Local Government Area. We cannot say if there is any casualty for now”, the source said. He also said men of the Nigerian Air Force were swift in responding to the distress calls from the villagers because “We can see their helicopters hovering in the air to get the bandits”. Efforts to reach the Chairman of the Rafi Local Government council, Alhaji Ismaila Isa Modibo for comment were unsuccessful as his phone was switched off. However, Director General, Niger State Emergency Management Agency, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, when contacted on phone confirmed the incident. “We received the report some minutes ago but I do not have the details yet” he said.
