The Nigerian Shippers’ Council says it is collaborating with the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to ensure adequate safety of port users nationwide in furtherance of its support for the COVID-19 pandemic fight. The Council’s Head of Public Relations, Rakiya Zubairu, stated that hundreds of face masks and hand sanitizers would be handed over to the leaders of seven trucking associations. She explained: “This is particularly significant because truckers, being essential workers, are some of the few people who are allowed to move across state lines as they deliver essential cargoes all around the country. “It may be recalled that NSC, through the Federal Ministry of Transportation, had made an intervention for this category of persons to be allowed free movement as they convey goods from the ports to the lengths and breaths of Nigeria and indeed beyond the borders of the country”, she added Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
