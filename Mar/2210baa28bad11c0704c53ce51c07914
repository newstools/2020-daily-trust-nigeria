The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has advised owners of articulated vehicles to always abide by the laid down laws guiding movement into, and out of the city. Malam Bello gave the advice when a delegation of national executives of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and Petroleum Tanker Drivers led by NUPENG’s national President, Comrade Prince William Akporeha, paid a courtesy visit to the FCT Administration. According to a statement by the minister’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, traffic laws specify that articulated vehicles were restricted from plying roads in the mornings and early evenings, stressing that the law was in place to safe guard lives and property He said: “There are timings as to when articulated vehicles are allowed to move. And normally, the restrictions are mainly in the morning and early evening along the major arterial roads of Gwagwalada, Suleja and Mararaba so that tanker movements will not clash with the heavy vehicular movement in the city at such hours.” The National Chairman, Petroleum Tanker Drivers Branch of NUPENG, Comrade Otunba Oladiti Akanni Salimon, said development of any city should not be left to government alone, hence the association’s pledge to collaborate with the FCTA in order to contribute its quota to the development of the territory.
