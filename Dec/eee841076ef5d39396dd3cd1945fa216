The Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Hon Marcus Onobun, has said that the declaration of the seats of 14 APC members-elect as vacant by the house still subsists. Onobun said this on Tuesday in Benin during an interview with journalists. He became the speaker after the impeachment of Hon. Frank Okiye by the 10-member House. Meanwhile, the factional speaker of the House, Hon. Victor Edoro, has insisted that he is the authentic leader since he has the majority number behind him. He said he has the majority with 14 members while the others were 10 members.
