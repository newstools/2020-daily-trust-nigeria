The Commonwealth Medical Association (CMA) has condemned the recent assault of a female medical doctor at the Maitama District hospital, Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, by relatives of a patient who died while under the care of the hospital. The attack which took place last Thursday, two days after the demise of the patient, was said to have been preceded by severe threats to the life of the female medical doctor. Speaking during a protest in the FCT, the president of the Commonwealth Medical Association, Dr. Osahon Enabulele, told journalists that it was the second case of assault of medical doctors in Maitama District hospital. He said six health workers, four doctors and two nurses have been assaulted across the FCT in the last six months. “While the CMA is not currently in a position to make a declarative statement on the pre-morbid personality, character and motives of the elements behind this unholy assault of the female medical doctor, the CMA strongly condemns this barbaric violation of the female physician’s dignity, human rights and physician autonomy. He, however, said  the association condoled with  the family of the late patient and prayed for the repose of her soul. “The CMA similarly expresses her deep sympathy with the assaulted female medical doctor and calls for a total overhaul of Maitama District hospital, particularly its security architecture,” he said. The president further called on the Nigerian Medical Association to ensure that Maitama District hospital undertakes the full rehabilitation of the female medical doctor.
