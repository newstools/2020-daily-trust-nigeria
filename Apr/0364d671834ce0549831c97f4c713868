The Chairman of National Labour Congress in the FCT, Abubakar Alhassan Yakub, has urged area council administrations to pay its workers the new national minimum wage arrears. Yakub, in his message to mark the May Day celebration in Abuja, said area council workers and primary school teachers in the FCT are yet to receive arrears. “We commend the federal government and the FCT Administration for implementing and paying arrears of the new minimum wage in 2019. We want to reiterate to the area councils that the arrears have increased from April 2019 to date. Therefore, they must make hay while the sun shines,” he said. He urged workers to use this year’s celebration being the 60th independence anniversary of Nigeria to take stock of their performances over the years. “There is a need for Nigerian workers to take stock of these 60 years. It will also enable us to appreciate the labour of our heroes past,” he said. While commending the government for its efforts in curbing the spread of coronavirus he said health workers and other essential workers at the frontline should be well protected. “This has also opened up many issues surrounding poor health   facilities   in   the   rural   communities.   Therefore,  to   be   able   to   achieve universal health coverage for the populace, the FCT Administration must make primary health care facilities functional,” he said.
