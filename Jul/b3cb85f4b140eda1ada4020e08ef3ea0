The police in Lagos said yesterday they have arrested five members of an armed robbery gang for allegedly attacking some traders and workers along the Itire road, Isolo. The police identified four of the arrested suspects as Segun Oladokun, 18; Oluwasegun Ajaoyin, 28; Nathaniel, 22; and Sunday Achadu, 30. Phones, cash, laptops and wristwatches, which they allegedly stole from their victims at gunpoint, were said to have been found on them. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, told our correspondent yesterday on phone that the suspects ambushed the traders and some factory workers on Itire road on Friday. Elkana said that at about 8.41pm, a source fed the police information to the effect that some armed robbers had been sighted at Johnson bus stop, Itire, dispossessing workers who were returning from work of their phones, money and other valuables. “On the receipt of the information, operatives from the Itire police station were mobilised to the scene. Items recovered from the suspects included one cut-to-size locally made pistols with four live cartridges, one expended cartridge, two cutlasses and a hammer,” he added.
