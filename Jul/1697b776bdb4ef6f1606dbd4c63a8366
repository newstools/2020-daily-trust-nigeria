The All Progressives Congress (APC) Professional Forum has asked President Muhammadu Buhari, governors elected on the platform of the party, Chief Bola Tinubu and other stakeholders to resolve the crises in the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. Addressing newsmen at the APC National Secretariat on Monday, in Abuja, the national coordinator of the forum, Akeem Akintayo, said some members of the party were yet to withdraw their cases in court, contrary to Buhari’s directive and the National Executive Committee (NEC). The forum urged the national leadership of the party to take disciplinary action against those still acting in defiance of the NEC directives. It urged President Buhari to help the reconciliatory process of the party by releasing appointment for boards to help boost the party’s reward system amongst many aggrieved members that have worked for the party without reward.  2023: Buhari, Tinubu, govs, urged to resolve APC crises APC crisis: Oshiomhole needs to redeem his image - Govs forum DG Ekiti APC forum adamant on court case despite Buhari’s plea
