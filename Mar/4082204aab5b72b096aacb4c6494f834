A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo State, Ugwumba Uche Nwosu, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the peaceful resolution of the crisis that almost engulfed the party. Nwosu, who spoke to our correspondent, commended the fatherly role the president played in calming frayed nerves in the party’s crises. He said the peaceful resolution of the crisis has ended all speculations that the party would implode at the end of the present regime. The party chieftain, however, enjoined the national chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, and members of the National Working Committee (NWC) not to end the process of reconciliation at the federal level, but also ensure that it is extended to the state chapters of the party. “I want to commend Mr President for his prompt intervention in the APC crisis which resolved the matter. At this point, the NWC of the party should move into the states and reconcile all aggrieved members,” he said.
