The Etsu of Yaba Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, a prominent farmer in Abaji Area Council of the FCT, has said that COVID-19 remains a threat to food security. Adamu, who spoke through his media consultant, Dr, Godwin Nyitse, said the pandemic is raging at a time the country is entering a new cropping season and its impact on farming would be negative. The chief said, “the effect on food production would be immediate and would manifest in reduction in supply with an increase in demand and subsequent increase in cost.” Adamu said agriculture as a labour intensive enterprise involves various stakeholders who are now negatively impacted by the lock down. “Markets are also closed down while the effect on research may not be noticed now although there is serious negative effect on the agricultural value chain system in the nearest future. “Agricultural research is time-set, it requires constant periodic observations and support services such as constant power supply, among other conditions. In the absence of any of the required conditions at any point, the validity and accuracy of the result of such research if not terminated cannot be guaranteed, resulting in loss of time and resources and reduction in research output,” he added. He urged governments at all levels to put measures in place to ensure the food production and supply chain is not disrupted as that would have dire consequences on food security.
