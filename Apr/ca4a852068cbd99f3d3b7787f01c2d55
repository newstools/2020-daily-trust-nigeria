The Society for Peace Studies and Practice (SPSP), Ogun State chapter, yesterday lamented that the stimulus packages rolled out by the state government have not reached the poor and vulnerable in some parts of the state. The state chairman of the group,  Sodiq Ola-Raheem, disclosed this on Thursday shortly after he led members of the body to make cash donations to the aged in Ijemo Agbadu, Okejigbo, Lantoro, Imo, Oke- Yeke, Kemta Oloko, Iyetedo, all communities in Abeokuta, the state capital. He equally lamented what he called absence of government in those areas, saying the aged suffer from lack of access to healthcare and other amenities. “SPSP is not unaware of the economic situation in the country. Of course there is every reason for us as a responsive organization to support what the government in the state is doing. “But I never knew the situation has gotten to this level. The gap between the extreme poor and rich is inhumane. These people are poorest of the poor groaning in pain, agony and hopelessness,” Ola – Raheem said. He disclosed that no fewer than 47 aged men and women benefitted from the cash donation, which was meant to cushion the effect of the lockdown. The SPSP Chairman called on Governor Dapo Abiodun to come to the aid of the vulnerable as well as the youths to guard against criminality during the lockdown.
