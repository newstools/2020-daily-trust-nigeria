The Nigeria Immigration Service yesterday said it had received 13 Nigerians who arrived from Lome, Togo, at Seme-Krake joint border post. The NIS spokesman, Sunday James, in a statement yesterday, said the returnees were technicians who went to install industrial machines in Togo. He said they had been handed over to officials of the Ministry of Health in Lagos for medical test. James said they were also for isolation in line with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Controlâ€™s directives on medical procedures for new arrivals into the country to curtail the spread of coronavirus. He noted that Seme-Krake was a major entry-exit point into and out of Nigeria, bordering Benin Republic. He said the NIS was not taking chances in enforcing strict border patrol. He said the Service would apprehend anyone who wanted to circumvent the approved routes, hence the numbers that had been turning up through the Seme-Krake border post since the border closure.
