Officials of the Nigeria Customs Service, Seme Area Command, Lagos, at the weekend intercepted a consignment of Tramadol, melon and fish allegedly being smuggled into the country from Benin Republic. The suspects were said to have fled after they were apprehended, abandoning the truck in which they were conveying the items that were carefully concealed under bags of used clothes and shoes. The recovery came barely a week after officials of the Command raided warehouses and stores owned by suspected drug traffickers along the Badagry-Seme axis. The Acting Comptroller, Seme Area Command, Chedi Dalha, told journalists yesterday that officials of the Command had been placed on alert after they received information that some people were planning to smuggle in illicit drugs from Benin Republic. Dalha explained that three weeks of surveillance after that information paid off at the weekend. “The intensified activities of the Anti-smuggling Unit of the Command under my watch in the last three weeks have recorded tremendous achievements. This latest interception came on the heels of that of 782 packets and 630 cards of Tramadol, and nine 400ml packs of Amphetamine syrup with a duty paid value (DPV) of N4,740,132 intercepted along the Elejah-Mowo axis. “In the same vein, a total DPV of N19,418,806 was realized during the period under review from the following seizures: 275 bags of rice (50kg each), 9,225 litres of premium motor spirit, 11 25-litre jerry cans of vegetable oil, 132 cartons of frozen poultry products, 105 textile materials, 12 sacks of used clothings, one sack of used shoes, three sacks of used ladies hand bags, 326 pieces of cream, 10 sacks of melon, one sack of stockfish and 30 cartons of Choco drink,” he added.
