The Presidency on Wednesday warned governors who might be allegedly cornering funds meant for their Local Government Areas to desist or face trial after their immunity expired. The Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, disclosed this via a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Edet Ekpenyong Etuk. According to Etuk, the presidential aide stated this while featuring on the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) Network Service programme tagged: “Issues of the moment” in Abuja. He said that Enang charged the Accountant-General of the Federation and Attorney-General of the Federation, to monitor the spending of funds allocated to the states in order to rescue government at the grassroot. “Let the governors know that they would be made to stand trial in accordance with the extant law when their immunity is eventually lifted,” the statement quoted Enang as saying. The President’s aide noted that most of the Local Government Areas offices have been taken over by weeds while most of the Primary Health Care Centres do not function, adding that “nurses there are staying at home and collecting salaries for doing nothing.” “The Local Government Areas have been kidnapped, arrested, imprisoned and bastardised by the governors, supported by the states’ House of Assemblies. The Supreme Court has done her best to redeem the LGA in view of its past judgments,” he noted.
