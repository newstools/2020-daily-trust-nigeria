Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, yesterday said any official found selling the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination forms above the official price of N4, 000, would be arrested and prosecuted by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. He asked candidates charged above the approved fee by any selling outlet including private Computer Based Test centres and banks to report to the nearest NSCDC office. Oloyede, at a meeting with stakeholders at the NSCDC Headquarters in Abuja, said the N3, 290 out of the N4, 000 paid by applicant was for the form, N500 for booklet; while N210 was for bank charge. He said so far, one bank as well as several CBT centres and schools in Anambra, Delta, Bayelsa, Enugu, Rivers and Adamawa States were found to have increased the amount and that punitive measures were taken against them. ‘Selling UTME form above N4,000 attracts prosecution’ – JAMB Registrar JAMB: Two arrested for increasing UTME registration cost in Delta Teacher caught impersonating brother in UTME
