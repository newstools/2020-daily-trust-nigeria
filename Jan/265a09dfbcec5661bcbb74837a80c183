The APC in Zamfara State has alleged that two monarchs in the state were suspended after they stood as sureties for two ex-commissioners who are members of the party. The suspended monarchs are Alhaji Garba Kanwa also known as Sarkin Yakin Zurmi, the district head of Kanwa and Alhaji Muhammad Bello Yusuf lll, Marafan Bakura. Speaking with our correspondent, the state chairman of APC in the state, Alhaji Lawali M. Liman faulted the suspension of the monarchs. “It is really a disturbing trend because the monarchs are not politicians; they are fathers to all irrespective of party affiliations.  They belong to no political party. Why then should they be punished for standing to receive the ex-commissioners?,” he said. However, the state government through the Senior Special Adviser to governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle on Publicity, Enlightenment Media and Communication, Malam Zailani Bappah, punctured the party’s claims. “Only one monarch, Alhaji Garba Kanwa from Zurmi emirate, was suspended and his suspension has to do with security in his domain. So for them to say the monarch was suspended because of their decision to receive the detained ex-commissioners is mischievous,” Bappah said. Daily Trust reports that two top members of the party, ex-commissioner of education, Alhaji Ibrahim Dan Maliki Gidan Goga and ex-commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Bello Dankande Gamji, were arrested and jailed by a court. They were however granted bail after spending about two months in the Nigerian Correctional Service. Part of the bail conditions was that two district heads must stand as sureties for them.
