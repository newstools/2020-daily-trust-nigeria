Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) will commence hourly services on the Abuja-Kaduna route effective from next month. Currently, the train services operate within intervals of about three hours. The Managing Director of NRC, Mr. Fidet Okhiria, who disclosed this to our correspondent at the weekend, also said the recently procured two locomotives and eight coaches are expected to arrive Kaduna by first week in April, 2020 and they will be commissioned immediately and put to use. He also said with the new capacity, more express services will be introduced for individuals who want to travel fast without the disruptions of stopping at every station, however, with a price. Okhiria said: “Two locomotives have arrived. You know it’s not easy to move them by road. We hope that in the next three weeks, the two locomotives and eight coaches would have arrived Kaduna. Immediately we will commission them and we will start operations with them. With that we can have the hourly train. “There will be non-stop train to Kaduna. At the same time, the price will not be the same again because of the number of seats there. We have the one that can only take 24 people, we have another two that can take 56 people and the normal one. So we don’t expect people who will relax their chair to also pay the same price” he added. The NRC boss said there will be no general price review except the new extra comfort service. Okhiria, who also spoke on the improved revenue of the corporation, confirmed that the monthly turnover now hovers between N180m to N200 million, while the cost of operations, covering cleaning, washing, security fuelling maintenance but excluding staff salaries, is about N100 million.
