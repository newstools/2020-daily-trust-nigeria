She said, “When a society chooses to kill such offenders, they die and do not remember the crime they committed against humanity. “We will involve every member of the community in this battle against rape…And in conjunction with all the security outfits and NAPTIP in the FCT, we are in the watch, and for any offender that we get, we will take it to any length to ensure that he is not fit to live. “We are also pushing for serious institutional framework that will ensure that justice is done. It is not enough to just jail such person, definitely punishment like castration will do. When we kill them, they die not remembering anything. Therefore, they should be castrated and left to roam the streets and remain inactive.” To castrate or not to castrate Activist advocates castration of rapists Female lawyers advocate castration for rapists
