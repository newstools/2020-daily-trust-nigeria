The House of Representatives says it will pass the Second Economic Stimulus Bill to strengthen the economy in the face of COVID-19 pandemic challenges in the country. Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila disclosed this in an address during the resumed plenary on Tuesday. The house had passed the first Economic Stimulus Bill before it went on recess about a month ago. He said the house would seek to pass a second Economic Stimulus Bill to provide necessary relief to individuals and corporate organisations in Nigeria. “Whichever way we go, the total defeat of this virus must be our immediate goal and our highest priority,” he said. According to him, the palliative schemes initiated by the administration had helped alleviate the sufferings of some of the most vulnerable populations. He however said many people had not benefited from any of the implemented measures.
