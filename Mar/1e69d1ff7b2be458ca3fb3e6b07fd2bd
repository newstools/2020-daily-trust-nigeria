The House of Representatives yesterday set up an ad-hoc committee to look into the continuous impact of the coronavirus on the global crude oil price. This was sequel to a motion of urgent public importance moved by James Falake (APC, Lagos) who said the fall in the global oil price should be urgently looked into so that the country would not be taken off balance in meeting its obligations to citizens. The motion was adopted and referred to the ad-hoc committee to be chaired by James Faleke (APC, Lagos) and Musa Sarki Adar (APC, Sokoto) as deputy chairman.
