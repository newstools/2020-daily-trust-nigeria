The Lagos State government has disclosed its plan to establish fruit orchards in 20 secondary schools to fast-track a development policy of tree planting and re-greening the environment among students and youths in the state. This was disclosed on the Lagos State government’s twitter handle, @followlasg. The state’s Acting Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya, explained that the essence of planting fruit trees in selected secondary schools was to encourage students to become healthy, productive and conscious of their immediate environment. Olusanya emphasised the importance of tree planting in a coastal city like Lagos, saying that the exercise would contribute in no small measure to the transformation of Lagos into a greener, healthier, safer and more orderly state.

She further noted that the exercise would encourage fruit consumption among students, saying fruits provide micronutrients to the body. Students of selected schools, she said, would be engaged to set up nurseries, tree planting and other conservation activities to encourage involvement and participation in agricultural practices and environmental education.
