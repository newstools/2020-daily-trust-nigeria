Katsina State indigenes based in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have called on the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency impose a state of emergency on the state following unabated killings. The group under the aegis of Concerned Katsina Youths Vanguard (CKYV) expressed concern over the wanton killing of innocent people in the state, saying it appeared the problem was beyond the state government. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the deputy spokesman of CKYV, Alh. Shamsudeen Danasibi Faskari, said residents of the state were living in fear of the unknown as even security agents in the state appeared helpless. Alhaji Shamsudeen, who lamented that his local government area was the epicentre of the killings since December, 2019, stressed that other parts of the state were currently under siege by bandits.

Faskari further said, “We have watched with heavy hearts how our people are being slaughtered like sheep and goats. We have also watched helplessly how communities are being invaded and how families and kindred are being wiped out by bandits while security agents appear helpless. “We have crossed the Rubicon and there is no turning back. Therefore, we are calling on the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency impose a state of emergency on the state. The Federal Government should take over the security apparatus of the state until lives and property of citizens are guaranteed’’.
