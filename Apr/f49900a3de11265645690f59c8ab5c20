A 14- year -old student of the Government Secondary School (GSS) Abaji, Ekene Ezeh, has been electrocuted. The father of the deceased, Mr. Augustine Ezeh, while narrating the incident to our reporter on Saturday, said it happened last Wednesday afternoon around 2:pm, when electricity was restored in the area. He said he was at his workshop when someone rushed in to alert him that his son had been electrocuted. “I immediately rushed to see my son (Ekene) foaming from his nose and mouth, and when I grabbed him, his body shocked me too. I had to use a wooden bench to push him down,” he said. According to him, his son died before he arrived the Abaji General Hospital. Ezeh, who is a vulcanizer, stationed in front of a filling station in the area, said he suspects that his son died as a result of electric shock from a naked wire that passed through a zinc in a kiosk close to where he works. He said the remains of his son, which have been deposited at the general hospital’s morgue, would be conveyed to the eastern part of the country for burial this week. Reacting, the spokesman of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) Mr. Oyebode Fadipe, said, “In fact, such incident was not reported to us, but we have  established contact with the deceased family and the management will engage the legal and safety department of the AEDC to reach out to the family,” he said.
