A faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State loyal to the party’s governorship candidate in the 2019 election, Senator Buruji Kashamu, yesterday disowned the peace pact reportedly reached between the two warring groups in the state. Kashamu and the other PDP group led by former House of Representatives member, Ladi Adebutu, had been at loggerheads over the structure of the party. But on Wednesday, the two groups met with the National Chairman of PDP Uche Secondus where they reportedly agreed to sheath their swords. However, the factional state chairman of PDP loyal to Kashamu, Bayo Dayo told newsmen yesterday that they were not party to the reconciliatory moves. Dayo tackled Secondus, saying he was only interested in “bread and butter politics” and not the unity of the party. “For the meeting held in Abuja, we are not part of it. Our former secretary who was present there has been suspended before now but we have been tackling that in-house and that is why we haven’t told you people,” he said.
