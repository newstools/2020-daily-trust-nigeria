The introduction of methanol technology will go a long way in reducing gas flaring in the country, the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has said. Dr Onu disclosed this during the 2nd Inter-Ministerial meeting of the implementation of the National Policy on Methanol Fuel Production Technology in Abuja yesterday. He explained that Nigeria’s enormous gas resources would be converted into useful products, through methanol technology, thereby paving the way for other businesses to grow. He added that the demand for gas by these businesses will tremendously reduce gas flaring. The minister further said with methanol, usage of kerosene and firewood to cook will be reduced to the barest minimum, thereby reducing deforestation. Dr. Onu further said that methanol will also impact positively in transportation, power generation and manufacturing. He said methanol is a major raw material in industrial production and will go a long way in boosting our economy.
