Persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Osun State yesterday demanded inclusion in the socio-economic and political life of the state. This was the thrust of a meeting in Osogbo, the state capital, between representatives of the Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD) and management of the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission (OSIEC). The meeting was facilitated by The Albino Foundation, under the European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (TAF/EU-SDGN) Project. The project supervisor in the state, Mr Kehinde Ogunbiyitan, spoke on the need to enhance the participation of PWDs in Nigeria’s socio-economic and political activities. The Chairman, Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD) in Osun State, Mr Kehinde Onitiju, said PWDs should be given a sense of belonging in the society. The Chairman of OSIEC, Otunba ‘Segun Oladitan, assured the PWDs that they would not be marginalised in the forthcoming local government election in the state. Oladitan said they would be given special consideration to enable them participate actively in the process without going through “avoidable” stress. He also declared that PWDs intending to contest in the election would pay one quarter of the nomination fees to enable them participate easily.
