The Area Commander of Metro Command of the Nigeria Police, FCT, Abuja, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Nuruddeen Sabo, has been honoured with the Paragon of Hope Award. Presenting the award to Sabo in his office last weekend, the National Coordinator of Nigeria Youth Advocacy for Good Governance Initiative, Shehu Ibrahim, said the association recognises those who have contributed to youth empowerment and have shone the light for the youth to follow, in their respective disciplines. Ibrahim said the top cop is a role model because of his discipline and passion to serve humanity and thus deserves to be recognised. “This group is proud of him because he is disciplined in his work and he touches lives with compassion,” the national coordinator of NYAGGI said. Responding, Sabo said he was elated to receive the award, which he dedicated to his subordinates and colleagues, saying he would not have done much without their support and cooperation. He assured that he will work harder to make Abuja a safer place for all.  My performance earned me ANAN award – FCT UBEB director city 1 6 killed as gunmen attack Emir of Potiskum in Kaduna
