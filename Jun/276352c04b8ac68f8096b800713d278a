The Royal School of Educational Therapy Foundation (RSETF) based in the FCT has called for the inclusion of persons with disabilities, especially in the entertainment industry. The Chief Executive Officer of  RSETF, Dr. Badewa Adejugbe-Williams, told journalists on Sunday during the filming of a movie titled: “Yes, We Can (Not A Burden)”, that telling stories of  persons with neurodevelopmental disabilities by some Nollywood and Hollywood celebrities in their own words would demonstrate to the world that there was ability in disability. Dr. Adejugbe-Williams said the project was directed and produced by a notable Nollywood director and producer, Lancelot Oduwa Imasuen. According to her, “RSETF having seen the need for inclusiveness and integration, particularly of children living with disabilities, with the belief that every person should be given every opportunity of academic excellence, talent development and skills acquisition, has been empowering persons with neurodevelopmental disabilities with life and vocational skills, and quite a number of the children have been learning and thriving. So, we embarked on the development of the movie titled: “Yes, We Can (Not a Burden)”. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. Mr. Imasuen described the movie as the height of inclusiveness, adding that it broke all records as the most challenging film project ever embarked upon. The movie parades other notable celebrities like Francis Duru, Empress Njama, Ali Nuhu, Paul Sambo, Fiona Garuba, Damilola Ogunsi and Fred Bright.
