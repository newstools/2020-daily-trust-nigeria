About $300,000 has been spent by the Origin Automobile Works (OAW) to train 50 youths as part of its efforts to reduce youth unemployment and increase skill acquisition cum capacity building in Nigeria. The company says it costs between $6,000 to $7,000 to train each intern. The internship programme, organized by OAW was designed to attract fresh, young graduates of mechanical and agricultural/bio resources engineering and taking them through a rigorous and qualitative hands-on three month graduate engineers’ internship programme. The 2020 training, which is the third edition, was designed for 150 graduate engineers and technicians out of which 50 young engineers were inducted during the week in Lagos. The youths, which comprised of men and women were trained on the assembly, diagnosis, maintenance and repairs of agricultural machines, including tractors, mechanical planters, harrows, and other relevant implements. According to the General Manager of OAW, Kunle Dabiri, the youths were trained to maintain tractors as the lack of after-sales service and maintenance has drastically reduced the expected life span of brand new tractors and related implements in Nigeria. “There is no gainsaying that the need exists for continued and sustained supply of trained and qualified personnel to ensure adequate and up-to-date maintenance of farm tractors and implements.” He stressed that, “Nigeria needs 1.5 million tractors to be at par with global average in terms of tractor penetration per square kilometre, but the less than 10,000 functional tractors in the country are a far cry from the recommended minimum standard by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO).” NDE trains 30 unemployed youths on environmental beautification Samsung produces 72 ‘smart engineers’ in Nigeria Jos Business School trains SURE-P graduating interns
