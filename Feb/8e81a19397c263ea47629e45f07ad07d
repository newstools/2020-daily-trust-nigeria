First Lady Aisha Buhari yesterday received former First Lady Turai Yar’Adua, at the State House, Abuja. Mrs Buhari broke the news of the visit of Hajiya Yar’Adua who came along with her daughter, Zainab Dakingari, on her Instagram page yesterday. Mrs Buhari wrote: “I was pleased to see Mrs Yar’Adua in high spirit. We rubbed minds on a number of issues that touch on gender-based violence, drug abuse and youth development in Nigeria. “I also got to hear about her experience and perspectives on these issues. “I conducted her round the area of what used to be her former office and while she reminisced her time in the State House, she also inspected the pictures of former first ladies in the conference hall, which she initiated during her time in order to honour all the Nigerian former first ladies.” Hajiya Yar’Adua had not visited the State House since her husband died on May 5, 2010.
