The Lagos State government, through its Safety Commission, has commenced physical verification and issuance of provisional safety compliance certificates to social clubs and centres that have registered with the Commission and their locations verified. The Director-General of the Lagos State Safety Commission, Mr Lanre Mojola, who commended the level of compliance with stipulated safety guidelines by most of the clubs visited so far, stressed the need for facilities to fully embrace issued directives, particularly on physical distancing and proper hygiene. Some of the social clubs/centres the Safety Commission had already visited are the Ikoyi Club, Lagos Motor Boat Club, Lagos Polo Club, Ikeja Country Club, Lagos Jetski Club, Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, Yoruba Tennis Club and Ikeja Golf Club. Mojola urged business owners who were yet to comply with the ‘Register-to-Open’ policy to do so, saying, “It will be in the best interest of all social, event and betting centres, bars, night clubs, gaming arcades, casinos and all the businesses captured under the ‘Register-to-Open’ initiative to do so in earnest to allow the verification process take place.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.

Maintaining that the only way to flatten the curve of COVID-19 pandemic in the state was through collective efforts with all stakeholders, Mojola enjoined all business owners in Lagos to cooperate with the state government in adhering to all safety guidelines.
