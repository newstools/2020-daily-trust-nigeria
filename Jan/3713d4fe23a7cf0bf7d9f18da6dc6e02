In an effort to address the incessant crises in Plateau State, the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace (IDFP) at the weekend established an early warning, early response, mediation and interreligious dialogue units. The units which comprise members of both the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Jamaâ€™atu Nasrul Islam (JNI) are expected to serve as avenues to address human rights violations being disguised under the cover of religion. Members of the mediation units would also shoulder the responsibility of documenting updates about any measure taken to prevent, counter and respond to instances of incitement, and also initiate joint statement and responses, including coordinating actions through social media. Speaking at the event held at both the CAN and JNI secretariats in Jos the state capital respectively, the co-chairman of IDFP and central coordination council, Muhammad Jameel Muhammad, said peaceful coexistence is topmost priority. He said the mediation units will serve as avenues and platforms for all voices to be heard, foster interreligious engagement, engage in persistent and ongoing dialogue with religious groups, including those who hold extremist views, and further encourage the development of interfaith seminaries. He said 10 interfaith mediation teams have been created in five states of Plateau, Benue,Taraba, Kaduna and Zamfara, and that the trained religious leaders and actors would spearhead the establishment of two mediation teams in each of the five states. At the event, Director-General, Plateau Peace Building Agency (PPBA), Joseph Lengmang, represented by Timothy Gayi, assured that the agency would collaborate with all faith organizations, Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and other corporate entities to initiate and broker peace in the state.
