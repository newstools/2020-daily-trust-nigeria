Salisu Majigiri was re-elected as chairman while Salisu Uli and Sanusi Iliyasu emerged as deputy chairman and secretary respectively. Speaking shortly after the election, Majigiri said the successful conduct of the primaries of the party across the state was a manifestation of its unity and fairness and a step towards reclaiming the state come 2023. He said, the task of doing so was made easier because of the dismal performance of the ruling APC in the state noting that “The APC has retarded the development of the state since its coming into office.” Others elected are, Abubakar Lawal (financial secretary), Bishir Tsani (publicity secretary), Yahaya Lawal (treasurer), Hajara Abubakar (women leader) and Lawal Bature (organizing secretary).
