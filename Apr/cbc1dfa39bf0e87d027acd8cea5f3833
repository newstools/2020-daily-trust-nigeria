The Senator representing Taraba Central in the National Assembly, Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, has objected to the federal government’s invitation of a Chinese medical team to help Nigeria in its coronavirus response. Dr Osagie Ehanire, Minister of Health, has said that the 18-member team of Chinese experts will be arriving soon with “globally scarce supplies” in the fight against coronavirus.
