Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, at the weekend said the sum of N3.4 billion was provided for in the 2020 budget for the establishment of a Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across the 17 local government areas of the state. Ugwuanyi, who gave this hint on Friday during the opening ceremony of the 31st Enugu International Trade Fair, said that an average sum of N200 million was appropriated for the projects in each of the 17 council areas. According to him, the rural development and job creation initiative was both government-driven and stakeholder-participatory, noting that the choice of the industry would depend on each of the local government’s comparative advantage. The governor also said that his government has “registered eight agricultural products brand trademarks including the Coal City Rice, which will be launched soon, all in a bid to make the difference and give back to our people”. On the theme of the Trade Fair ‘Advancing the Growth of SMEs through Corporate Governance for Rapid Economic Development’ the governor said the theme was apt since it captured the mood of the nation as an emerging economy, adding that SMEs are the most potent drivers of the economy, especially in developing countries. Stressing that the state government has invested a lot of time and energy to position Enugu as a destination of choice for genuine investors, Gov. Ugwuanyi explained that his administration has continued to create enabling environment for businesses to thrive over the past years.  “Pay salaries before Christmas’’ – Gov.
