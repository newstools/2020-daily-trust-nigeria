National chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, has said only states led by the leading opposition party are commissioning projects despite the COVID-19 pandemic. He said this in Sokoto State on Wednesday when he laid the foundation of a N2.8 billion twin bridge and dualization of Tashar Illela – Federal Science College road. Secondus, who commissioned a 1.5 million gallons of water project in Wamakko, said Governor Aminu Tambuwal was fulfilling his campaign promises to the people of the state. Earlier, Governor Tambuwal had said the road, which would link the metropolitan area with the eastern part of the state and Niger Republic, would ease transportation and boost economic activities in the state and beyond when constructed.
