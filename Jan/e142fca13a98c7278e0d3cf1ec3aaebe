Former Nigerian military president, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (rtd) has called on Nigerians to embrace peace and unite for sustainable existence of the country. Speaking to BBC on Wednesday about the fifty years after the Nigerian civil war, the retired general said instead of forming groups that will temper with the peaceful coexistence of the country, Nigerians should engage in activities that will foster development and unity. He said Nigerians should praise Almighty God for sustaining the country for fifty years after the war, adding that no country that engage in Civil war has witnessed thorough peace within a short period of time as Nigeria deed. “Nigeria is better the way it is now, all parts of the country should come together and see themselves as one and equal. Just like today it is fifty years after the civil war. As everybody knows so many good things have happened in the country, which is indeed better for all of us. So I think it is better if we put all our differences aside and work for the development of our nation”, Babangida said. He said Nigeria has learnt a lot of lessons from the civil war and should not make attempt to embark on it, adding that most of the people calling for war or conflict in the country were not alive during the period of the war. “Most of them are young between the ages of 30, so they don’t know what civil war is all about. As a military man who participated in war, I advise that we shouldn’t engage in war, let’s unite and leave in peace. That will be better”, he added.
