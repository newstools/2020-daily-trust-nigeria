The Edo Committee of Muslims (ECM) has demanded for at least the deputy governorship slot for all parties contesting for the September 2020 governorship election in Edo State. The president of the organisation, Malam Suleman Alasan and secretary, Malam Barham Ahmad, made the demand when they visited the corporate headquarters of Media Trust Limited in Abuja. Alasan, who spoke on behalf of the delegation, said since the creation of the Midwest region in 1963, to the present Edo State, a period spanning almost 60 years, Muslims in the state, despite their large population, have not produced a governor, deputy governor, SSG, chief of staff or any reasonable position in the state. “Politicians used the divide and rule policy against us and the compromise of some of our leaders worsens our situation. We want to say that we would not take anything short of having a Christian/Muslim joint ticket for all parties. This time around, it is ‘no Muslim, no vote’. The era of Christian-Christian ticket is over,” he said.
