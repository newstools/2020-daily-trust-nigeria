The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in collaboration with the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) yesterday sealed about 26 illegal gas retail outlets in Abuja and arrested about 22 persons operating the facilities. The closure of the stations and arrest were made by both agencies during an operation to rid the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and environs of illegal activities of gas retailers and operators. Daily Trust observed that most of the illegal outlets raided were sited within green areas, near a source of ignition and crowded commercial areas. Speaking after the raid, the Zonal Operations Controller DPR Abuja, Engr. Buba Abubakar said about 22 retailers were arrested for not being licenced by the DPR and siting their shops where they were not supposed to, adding that some of them were found smoking around those places, which is unacceptable. He said, “My advice to Nigerians is that they should always go to LPG refilling centres to refill their gas. They should not allow any roadside retailer to carry their cylinder and decant there. For LPG marketers and retailers, am advising them that this exercise is going to be a continuous one. They should come to the office to get licenced or regularised. Let them come and make it legal. This exercise is not intended to get them out of the market.” Abubakar said the retailers arrested will be handed over to the NSCDC for prosecution. On his part, the Deputy Commandant of Corps, NSCDC FCT Command, Felix Ikwuegbu said the suspects will be charged to court.
