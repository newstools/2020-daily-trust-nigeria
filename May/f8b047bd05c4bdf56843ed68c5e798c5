The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Niger State has expressed dissatisfaction over the swearing-in of a PDP candidate as the Chairman of Magama local government despite its appeal to Governor Abubakar Sani Bello against it. APC had on Monday called on Governor Bello to resist pressures to swear in the PDP candidate due to its appeal against the judgment of a lower court held in Minna, the state capital. The state APC chairman, Mohammed Jibrin Imam, who made the call, said the case was already before the Court of Appeal. The governor, on the other hand, swore in Safiyanu Yahaya of PDP as the Chairman of Magama Local Government Council.

Bello said he did it in obedience to the High Court ruling that quashed the November 30, 2019 local government council election in Magama local government on the ground of pre-election offence. Reacting, the chairman of APC said the working committee of the party had met and would convey their displeasure to the governor. “With the swearing-in of a PDP candidate, it the PDP manifesto that will be carried out in Magama local government. But I don’t expect the candidate to be sworn in since the case is still in the appeal court,” he said in a phone interview. Effort to speak with the PDP chairman in the state, Tanko Beji, through phone was unsuccessful.
