However, the NCDC is working hard to ensure that there is a laboratory for the testing of COVID-19 in each state. NCDC said that this will enhance access to testing and shorten the time for confirmation of result. Currently, the turnaround time is between 48-96 hours. Testing conducted through a laboratory within the NCDC network is offered free of charge. “Where do people go to get tested? If you are showing known symptoms of COVID-19 or believe you are a close contact of a confirmed case, call your state helpline. “The state officials will advise on the nearest testing centre or advise if a trained health worker will come to you to collect your sample,” it stated. NCDC said that it also has created a directory of all state helplines which can be accessed via https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/contact The health agency said that one of the most important things Nigerians needed to remember while awaiting their test result is the need to protect their loved ones.
