TAJBank, Nigeria’s leading and innovative non-interest bank, has announced the launch of its TAJMall, the nation’s first ethical online shopping mall. The launch of the e-commerce site is coming closely on the heels of the commencement of its non-interest lender’s Agency Banking Network which began in June across 13 states in the country. To celebrate this milestone, the brand commenced a week-long TAJMall campaign from last Monday to sensitize and also attract and reward new customers to its platform. Commenting on the E-commerce innovative platform, the Founder/COO TAJBank, Hamid Joda, enthused: “This is a great milestone as we present a fully customer focused e- commerce platform offering 100 percent authentic brands from highly vetted vendors. Our mission is to rebuild trust in the online shopping niche, hence the emphasis on our platform being an ethical shopping mall. “We want to deliver on our promise and make this an enjoyable and safe experience not just for our customers, but also for our numerous trusted vendors as well. Our customers place absolute trust that goods will be delivered exactly as requested, and we do not take that trust lightly, he added. The bank expressed its commitment to continuously deploy technological tools on its new e- platform to maintain optimal customer service delivery and ensure shopping on TAJMall remains a productive and hassle free experience.
