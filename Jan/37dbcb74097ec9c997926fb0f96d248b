The management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has called on its numerous customers to cultivate the habit of giving early warning reportage to prevent disaster in their communities from any faulty electrical equipment. The management observed the attitudes of some customers who often refuse to report minor faults until it poses serious danger or leads to disaster before reporting such. “We have trained our engineers who have been stationed for any complaints with regard to issues of faulty transformers and other electrical issues. This is also to caution against consulting quacks to fix faulty or operating on any KEDCO equipment as well as household installations. This is not acceptable. It is only KEDCO engineers that have the requisite training and right to work on our installations and equipment,” the company noted in a statement by its Head, Corporate Communication,  Ibrahim Sani Shawai . The management further observed that majority of the households prefer to call unqualified technicians who often use sub-standard electrical installations that often results to disaster and accidents. It noted that it has been observed that over 80 per cent of electrical accidents are caused by use of unqualified technicians. “In this regard, we are calling on all our customers to report any complaints on electrical issues to KEDCO technical staff for prompt actions to guarantee the safety of all our customers,” he added. The management also appealled to the public to report any attempt to sabotage any KEDCO installations and equipment, stressing that vandalism and equipment theft are causing a lot of damage.
