A business mogul, Chief Sam Ezediaro, yesterday, advised leaders of the South East to do away with opposition politics and flow with the centre to actualise their age-long ambition. Chief Ezediaro, a former Head of Lands, Texas Oil Company Nigeria Limited, said aligning with aggrieved leaders of other geopolitical zones to discredit the presidency was counter-productive. He said, “There is no future for the South East in the opposition. Igbo leaders should shun divisive tendencies and secessionist rhetoric. They should form strong alliances across the region with focus on building a corporate nation that is founded on love, tolerance and the rule of law.” ‘How Buhari’s ‘new’ gov’t should address Igbo concerns’ Buhari: What to do with the South East Blame South-East leaders for the zone’s socio-economic problems – Okechukwu
