The Osun State Rent Tribunal in Osogbo, Osun State, yesterday ordered a tenant, Lukman Ayeni, to vacate the apartment he is occupying at Atoyebi’s compound, Isale-Osun area, due to his inability to pay rent to his landlord. The landlord, Mr Lamidi Oyewusi, had dragged Ayeni to the tribunal for owing him rent arrears in the sum of N60,000, covering March 2019 to February 2020. Ayeni confirmed that he was owing his landlord a year’s rent, saying he had been unable to pay because of the country’s poor economic situation. Oyewusi told the tribunal that he would not be able to continue to tolerate Ayeni in the house if he was unable to pay the debt. In his verdict, the Chairman of the tribunal, N. O. Sanusi, ordered the tenant to vacate the house on or before March 31, 2020. Sanusi also ordered Ayeni to ensure payment of the arrears of his rent, including the one month rent for the month of March.
