Kano commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, has said the call for review of the Supreme Court judgement on the state governorship election by Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso shows that he is totally oblivious of judicial procedures that affirmed the electoral victory of the incumbent governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. Kwankwaso had last week asked the National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to seek for review of the apex court’s verdict on the 2019 governorship election in Kano, which upheld the election of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of the APC. Reacting to the call in a statement issued yesterday, the state’s commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, stated that it was very surprising that Kwankwaso could make the call for review  of the judgement considering the glaring defeat of his party, the PDP at the tribunal, appeal court and the Supreme Court. He said the Senator, who was quoted to have claimed ‘’voter disenfranchisement and manipulation of judicial processes in the Kano case, is just being driven by his mawkishness and apparently by the recent development in Imo and Bayelsa states, which scenarios are in no way comparable.” He pointed out that while some legal practitioners are looking at technical issues on the two cases, in Kano it is entirely a different game. “What the Supreme Court ruled was the affirmation of the judgement of the tribunal and Court of Appeal. That is to say the PDP failed woefully to prove their case and that is the substance of the case. Therefore, there is no basis what so ever for review of Kano case” Garba argued. 2019 guber judgement: Kwankwaso is oblivious of judicial process – Kano commissioner S/Court: Kwankwaso asks PDP NWC to seek review of Kano verdict ‘Why Kwankwaso refused to seek Senate re-election’
