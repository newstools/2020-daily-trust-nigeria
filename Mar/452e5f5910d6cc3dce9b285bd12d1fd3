Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has hailed the contributions of the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, to party politics and democracy in Nigeria. The commendation came as Secondus clocked 65 yesterday, March 22, 2020. Okowa, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, said Secondus’ “great and envious accomplishments” in various spheres of endeavour in the last 65 years made the celebration “imperative and well-deserving.” The governor said the PDP national chairman deserved commendation for his leadership role in improving the fortunes of the party since he assumed leadership in December, 2017. “As chairman of the biggest opposition party in Nigeria, you have played significant roles in the growth and development of the nation and we can’t thank you enough for your good deeds. “Your Excellency, the ideals of uncommon patriotism, unparalleled humility and sterling leadership qualities which you epitomise are worthy traits that will continue to inspire us in our Stronger Delta vision. “As you celebrate this day, it is my prayer and that of members of our great party in Delta, that God will continue to bless you with good health, wisdom and many more years in the service of God and country,” Okowa also said.
