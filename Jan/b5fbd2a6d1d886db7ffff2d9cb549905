The member representing Daura Local Government Area (LGA) in Katsina State House of Assembly, Nasir Yahaya, has donated sickle cell drugs and delivery kits worth millions of naira to four Health Centres in his domain. Daily Trust reports that about 1,500 sickle cell patients and 500 pregnant women are expected to benefit. Speaking at the presentation of the drugs, Yahaya said they were meant to complement the effort of the state government and assist the less privileged people in the society. He said adequate measures had been put in place to ensure that the drugs got to the real beneficiaries, calling on people to always find a way to support the less privilege in the society. In his remarks, the state Commissioner for Health, Engr.  Nuhu Danja, commended the foresight of the member for providing the drugs and called on prospective couples to always go for medical tests  before marriage. Engr. Danja said maternal mortality had drastically reduced in the state due to serious government intervention alongside development partners, adding that government will not relent but sustain the tempo. The Head of Daura Local Government Administration, Alh. Bishir Lawal Shargalle, said the donation was not the first of its kind from the lawmaker and called on others to emulate the gesture. He promised that the drugs would be judiciously used.‎ Sickle cell patients: We can’t get drugs in public hospitals Protest: People living with Sickle Cell storm hospitals, demand release of detained members Sickle cell patients seek availability of their routine drugs in public hospitals
