The governor of Lagos State, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, has described as “exciting” the decision of the Dangote Group to site its petroleum, fertilizer and petrochemical company in Lagos. Sanwo-Olu said Dangote’s decision is to the state’s advantage and would lead to real growth and development in the Lekki area and the state in particular. Sanwo-Olu, during his visit to the refinery site recently, described Aliko Dangote as “a rare breed” who has done so much towards youth employment and economic development of the country. “We are happy with this investment. It is an investment that is real and has come to stay. In fact, this is the largest single construction site anywhere in the world. We are truly excited. “Now, the question is, how do we key into this project? Part of the things we will be doing here is a comprehensive new infrastructure that will be coming to this corridor. We are closing up on two different road connections out of this place. One will go straight to Epe and the other will go towards Ijebu-Ode. “Just across here, we have the Lekki Deep Sea port. All these are comprehensively coming together, because we know that infrastructure has to come around all these conversations. We have to open up this place comprehensively, where people can come to work and live. It will be a full ecosystem that we are building up around here,” the governor said.
