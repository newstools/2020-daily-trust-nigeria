A Federal High Court in Ibadan, Oyo State, yesterday sentenced Ademola Lawal, a fake operative of the Department of State Services (DSS), to 12 years imprisonment for impersonation and N1.85 million fraud. Justice Patricia Ajoku convicted Lawal and sentenced him accordingly after he had pleaded guilty to the charges instituted against him. Ajoku said the judgment recognized the fact that the convict pleaded guilty and that there was a need to soften his punishment. “It is my belief that the convict is remorseful of his action and has demonstrated that he is willing to change and contribute positively to society. “Nevertheless, Lawal is sentenced to two years in prison for each of the six offences to serve as a deterrent to others. All sentences shall run concurrently. “In addition, Lawal shall pay the monies he fraudulently obtained from his victims, which shall be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria,” the judge said. Earlier, counsel to the DSS, Mr T. A. Nurudeen, had told the court that Lawal was arraigned on a six-count charge bordering on impersonation and threat. Nurudeen further said that the convict committed the crime between 2015 and 2019 before he was eventually apprehended. According to the prosecutor, Lawal separately obtained a cash sum of N1.5 million from the Director of FCMB, N200,000 from one Bako Danbata and N150,000 from one Ibrahim Bunkutu. He said that the convict told his victims that he was in the right position at the DSS to help them out of their problems with the agency. Nurudeen also said that Lawal intimidated and threatened two foreigners legitimately working at the Tin Can Island port in Lagos State through the internet.
