Katsina state government and the International Centre for Energy, Environment and Development ( ICEED)  have trained about 500 entrepreneurs in stove making and retailing. Arewa Trust Weekly reports that the stove, named Dadin Kowa, was developed to address deforestation by reducing the use of wood by up to 65 per cent. Speaking at the launching of the state’s Efficient Fuel Wood Action Plan Forum, the Executive Director of ICEED, Mr Ewah Eleri, said  more than 60,000 units of the stove have so far been sold both within and outside the state. According to him,‎ the project also seeks to sustainably improve the fuel wood balance in the state by increasing wood supply through farmer managed natural regeneration, whilst reducing fuel wood demand through dissemination and use of fuel wood efficient stoves. Earlier,  the Commissioner for Commerce, Muktar Kado, said the economic viability of the collaboration was enormous and could not be ignored. He said since its inception the present administration has been making efforts to ensure a   reduction in tree felling and boosting the planting of new ones to check desertification.
