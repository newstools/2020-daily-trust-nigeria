The Supreme Court has reserved ruling in the application for the review of the judgement which disqualified the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State in the 2019 general elections. A five-member panel of justices presided by the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, on Tuesday, announced that a new date will be communicated to the parties after listening to the parties. The ex-governor, Abdulazeez Yari’s faction of the APC, through their counsel, Robert Clarke (SAN), brought the application seeking a review of the consequential order of the apex court which voided the total votes polled by the APC in the election over the conduct of the October 3, 2018 primary of the party. But the counsel to the Senator Kabiru Marafa-led faction of the APC, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), asked the court to dismiss the application with punitive costs. Citing the recent cases in Bayelsa and Imo states and Section 235 and 285 of the Nigerian Constitution 1999, Ozekhome argued that the decision of the Supreme Court is final and cannot be reviewed.
