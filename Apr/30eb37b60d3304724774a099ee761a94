The Importers Association of Nigeria, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to allow for free movement as the second 14-day lockdown on the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Lagos, and Ogun States in order to stop the spread of the novel COVID-19 ends on midnight Monday. This is coming as Governors of the 36 States of the federation have advised the federal government to allow internal free movement but with restrictions on large gatherings and assemblies. The National Coordinator of the association, Chief Obi Michael Ekwego, who lauded President Buhari for taking decisive steps to contain the spread of the virus, said relaxing the lockdown, would give opportunity to revive the economy and also enable clearing agents to clear their goods, especially those that have short expiry duration, such as foods, drugs and chemicals. “These products were imported and stocked before the enforcement of the lockdown order. We need the economy to reopen so we can sell them before they expire,” he said The association appreciated the FG for suspending all applicable terminal storage fees on consignments (demurrage) for an initial period of twenty-one days effective March 23, 2020.
