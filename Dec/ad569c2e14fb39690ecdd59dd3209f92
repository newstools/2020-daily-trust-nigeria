The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Uche Secondus, has said that Nigeria is falling apart and fast becoming a failed state under the watch of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) . Speaking during the PDP mega rally in Sagbama local government area of Bayelsa State and presentation of flag to the party candidate, Chief Henry Seriake Dickson, Secondus said that the PDP believes in a united and strong Nigeria and remained the only party that can rescue the country from the grip of the failing APC. He lamented that everything in the country including economy and security sectors are falling apart. He stressed that the only chance of redemption opened to the citizenry was to put credible people in the National Assembly to make laws in defense of the people. But the APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary,  Yekini Nabena, in a telephone chat last night simply said, “We will not react until the PDP pay their staff salaries.” The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Uche Secondus, has said that Nigeria is falling apart and fast becoming a failed state under the watch of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) .
