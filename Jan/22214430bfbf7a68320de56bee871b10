Operatives of the Ogun State police command have arrested three men for allegedly stealing a four-year-old boy, Hammed Adeniran. The suspects – Abubakar Saidu, 22; Danladi Abdulkarim, 30; and 25-year-old Abdullah Idris –  were arrested on Friday following a complaint from the boy’s mother, Nimota Adeniran. The complainant was said to have reported at the Warewa police station that she was alerted by one of her neighbours that her son had been sighted with three strange men waiting to board a vehicle  at the Arepo bus stop, along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The spokesperson of the Ogun State police command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, explained in a statement yesterday that  the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) at Warewa, Folake Afeniforo, quickly mobilized a team of policemen to the bus stop. According to Oyeyemi, when the operatives reached the bus stop, they met the three men with the child in their possession. “On interrogation, the three suspects, who claimed to have come from Jigawa State, could not give any reasonable account of why the child was with them or why they wanted to board a commercial bus with him,” Abimbola said. He disclosed that the child had been reunited with his parents, while the suspects were undergoing interrogation. The spokesman said the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation and possible prosecution. Ebrimson advised parents to take the security and well-being of their children serious in order to protect them from those looking “for every means to be rich.”  Fake clerics nabbed for alleged fraud, serial rape Police nab 4 men for allegedly robbing churches Man allegedly rapes woman, 38, for rejecting advances
