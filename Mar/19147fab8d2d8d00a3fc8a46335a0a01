Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted two wives of a former secretary of Bwari Area Council, Alhaji Danjuma Aliyu Kawu, in Kawu community of the council. The two wives of the former council secretary are, Hajiya Huraira Danjuma Kawu and Hajiya Rabi Danjuma Kawu. A relation of the victims, who preferred anonymity, said the incident happened around 1:23 am last Wednesday, when the gunmen invaded the victims house. He said the gunmen forced their way into the house and when Kawu attempted to prevent the gunmen from taking away his wives, they injured him. He said the gunmen, after inflicting injuries on the victim, whisked away his wives into the bush. He said the family has established contact with the kidnappers and they are demanding N100 million ransom before the victims would be set free. “To God be the glory, the family has been able to establish contact with them, but they are demanding N100 million ransom,” he said. He said the husband of the kidnapped victims is currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Bwari. Alhaji Danjuma was a council secretary under the former chairman of Bwari Area Council, Isah Dara Bwari. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said the command was not aware of the incident, adding that he would find out and get back to our reporter but he was yet to do so at the time of filing this report.
