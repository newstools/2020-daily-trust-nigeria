Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have assured Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State that they would do everything democratically possible to help him achieve his second term ambition. Governor Obaseki recently dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and pitched tent with the PDP after he was denied the APC ticket. He was granted a waiver by the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) and consequently emerged candidate of the party for the September 19, 2020, governorship election in the state. The governors, through the Director General of the PDP Governors Forum, Hon. C.I.D. Maduabum, assured that the Edo governor would perform better in his second term. “We wish to use this opportunity to convey the solidarity of all your colleagues in the forum and to assure you of their support in the forthcoming election in Edo State. “We ask you to continue to work and embrace all the people of Edo State, particularly the downtrodden and the vulnerable. “We admire the job you have done in Edo State in your current term which informed the high level of confidence reposed in you by the PDP and the people of Edo State,” they said.
