The kidnappers of eight children of a retired director of the FCT Area Council Service Commission (ACSC) Alhaji Attahiru Pandagi, have demanded N100 million ransom before his children will be freed. City News had reported that gunmen suspected to be kidnappers in the early hours of Monday invaded the private residence of the retired director on Agyana Road, near Government Secondary School (GSS) in Abaji and abducted his eight sons including a 12 year – old boy. The father of the victims while speaking with our reporter on Sunday, said the kidnappers demanded N100 million after they established contact with the family on Saturday. He, however, said as negotiations continued from Saturday to Sunday, the kidnappers have brought the ransom down to N50 million. The retired director said the council chairman, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, whom he said travelled out of the town, called him to express his concern over the abduction of his children. “Actually the council Chairman called to express his sadness and concern over the incident, even as he said he was out of the town,” he said. When contacted, the spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, declined comments.
