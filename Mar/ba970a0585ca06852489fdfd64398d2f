Residents of Federal Capital Territory have complained about scarcity of face masks, an item needed to protect against the spread of Coronavirus disease. Residents who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria yesterday expressed concern over the unavailability of the commodity in the markets. NAN reports that Nigeria recorded its first confirmed case of coronavirus on Friday in Lagos. The index case was brought to the country by an Italian citizen who returned to Nigeria on Feb. 25 from a business trip in Milan, Italy. Joseph Abiodun told NAN in Gwagwalada that he had checked for face masks to buy in supermarkets and pharmacies in the area, but could not find any. Zainab Abubakar, another resident, said she used her weekend searching for face masks to buy in order to get prepared for the week, but couldn’t get any because it was not available in the markets. Similarly, Isaac Avoihi, a resident of Federal Housing in Lugbe, said he was ready to buy the face masks at any price because of its importance owing to the outbreak of the disease in Nigeria. Modinat Balogun told NAN that the scarcity of the face masks in her area and other parts of Abuja was worrisome. NAN reports that face masks were out of stocks in most supermarkets and pharmacies visited in Gwagwalada and Lugbe areas of FCT.
