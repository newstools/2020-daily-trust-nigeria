The Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has directed bureau de change (BDCs)  operators to comply with the new official exchange (forex) rate of N380 per dollar as well as other provisions of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) new forex policy regime. The association assured forex buyers of continued dollar sale at the new official exchange rate. The association stated this following the new exchange rate regime announced Friday night by the CBN for the disbursement of the proceeds of the international money transfer services operators (IMTOs) Under the new exchange rate regime, the IMTOs will sell to banks at N376 per dollar, while the banks will sell to the CBN at N378 per dollar. The CBN in turn will sell dollars to BDCs at N378 per dollar while the BDCs are mandated to sell to the public at N380. Expressing support to ensure effective implementation of the new exchange rate regime, ABCON stated that it would continue to partner with the apex bank to ensure exchange rate stability and orderly conduct of the forex market, especially at the retail segment where its members operate. To this end, it appealed to members of the public to patronise licensed BDCs to purchase dollars so as to avoid falling victim of currency hoarders and speculators, who are creating impression of dollar scarcity in the economy. ABCON also enjoins the public to report to its national secretariat any BDC operator selling above N380 per dollar. It maintained that given the sharp drop in demand for dollars due to the impact of the coronavirus on global trade and travels as well as continued dollar injection by the CBN, there was no pressure in the forex market to warrant any hike in the exchange rate above the official rate.  ‘CBN, ABCON partnership stabilises naira despite campaign spendings’ Naira ends year on high note over CBN, ABCON partnership FOREX: As CBN weighs options against BDCs
