The Senate has said it cannot declare vacant the seat occupied by ex-Bayelsa State deputy governor-elect, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, in the Red Chamber, “because there is no court pronouncement sacking him as a senator.” The Supreme Court had declared that Degi-Eremienyo submitted forged certificate to INEC, thereby sacking David Lyon and him as governor-elect and deputy governor-elect respectively on the eve of their inauguration. Based on the apex court’s verdict, PDP’s candidate, Senator Duoye Diri and his deputy, Senator Lawrence Ewhruojakpo, were sworn in. However, the embattled Degi-Eremienyo has said that all educational qualifications he presented to the electoral body were genuinely obtained from Nigerian institutions. Senate President Ahmad Lawan had, in a letter to INEC Chairman Mahmoud Yakubu, declared the seats occupied by both Diri and Ewhruojakpo in the upper legislative chamber vacant. Senate spokesman, Senator Godiya Akwashiki, told our correspondent that Degi-Eremienyo remains a member of the red chamber despite his certificate forgery imbroglio. Akwashiki said the court pronouncement only sacked him as deputy-governor elect but not as a senator. He said a lawmaker’s seat could only be declared vacant either by death, recall demand by constituents or court pronouncement ordering INEC to withdraw the certificate of return.
