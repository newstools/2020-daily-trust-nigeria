The governor of Rotary International, District 9125, Dr Victor Onukwugha, says rather than set good examples, politicians are making the current security challenges difficult to contain. He said this in Abuja yesterday at a positive peace workshop for senior secondary schools organized by Rotary Club of Abuja Metro, Rotary Club of Abuja, Maitama and Rotary Club of Abuja, Asokoro Diamond in collaboration with the Institute of Peace and Conflict Resolution. He pleaded with government to act fast in order to restore peace across the country by stopping hate actions. “As students, do not mind what is happening with the political class. They are not setting good examples. The world has become a global village and everybody is preaching peace. As students, wherever your school is you are going to compete with other students across the world. So, let us all see ourselves as one. “We must always ensure that peace reign. We must not allow war in Nigeria. Peace is peace and war is war. War is something that should not happen in this country. Everybody should embrace peace. Nigeria has reached a stage where we must call a spade a spade. It must be either we keep to peace or we forget it. There is nothing like war. Director General, Institute of Peace and Conflict Resolution, Bakut Bakut, said everyone must work together to ensure peace in the country.
