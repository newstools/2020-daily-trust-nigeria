Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege says Kaduna State Governor Nasir Ahmad El-rufai is a consistent and reform-minded performer. Omo-Agege said this in a felicitation letter he signed yesterday on the governor’s 60th birthday. He said the governor’s noble qualities were being appreciated by Nigerians within and outside his state. “Today, I join members of his family, citizens of Kaduna state and other Nigerians in celebrating the birthday of one of ours – the remarkable Nasir El-Rufai whose dogged pursuit of populist reforms left indelible imprints on the Bureau of Public Enterprises, the Ministry of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja which he superintended from July 16, 2003 to May 29, 2007 as well as other party and national assignments. “I pray that Almighty Allah continue to sustain his resolute determination to make enduring positive impacts in the lives of his constituents. “May good health, long life and fulfilment be his in the years ahead,” Omo-Agege said.
