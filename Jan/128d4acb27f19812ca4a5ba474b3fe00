The Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) says it has dragged the INEC to the Supreme Court over what it called its “unlawful” exclusion from the November 16, 2019 governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states. The National Chairman of the party, Alhaji Ganiyu Galadima, told newsmen yesterday in Abuja that his party fully complied with the election timetable issued by the electoral umpire by conducting its governorship primaries in Lokoja and Yenagoa respectfully on September 5, 2019 in the presence of the representatives of the INEC. Alhaji Galadima said the party met all requirements but was “unlawfully” excluded from the ballot. Both the Federal High Court and the Court of Appeal had earlier dismissed the ACPN’s case but its national chairman said the party was not pleased with the judgements of the lower Courts.
