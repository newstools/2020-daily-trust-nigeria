The Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC), disclosed at the weekend that it has so far installed  a total of 2,500  prepaid meters for its customers in Edo, Delta, Ondo and Ekiti states. The company’s Managing Director, Mrs. Funke Osibodu, made the disclosure in Benin, Edo State during an interactive session with journalists on the activities of the company in 2019. She said the company’s target was to install 10,000 unit meters for its customers in 2019, but due to some constraints it was not able to achieve the target, adding that metering of customers will improve considerably this year. The BEDC’s CEO assured that the installation of meters will help to curb estimated bill. Osibodu disclosed further that as part of efforts to bring electricity to all the communities in its franchise areas,  as at October 2019, the company successfully connected 48 communities  that had never been supplied electricity before to the national grid. Specifically, she confirmed that 20 communities were connected in Delta, 16 in Edo, six in Ondo while six were connected Ekiti State.
