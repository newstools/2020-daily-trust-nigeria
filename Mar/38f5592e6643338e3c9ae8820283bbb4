As the country prepared for social distancing and eventual lockdown over coronavirus, a Nasarawa councillor grabbed headlines by marrying two brides same day. Ibrahim Oboshi, councillor for Iwogu ward in Keana council area, and the two brides Nazira Ozegya and Rabi Akose, appeared to have planned their big day together all along.  All three names were printed on the invitation cards sent out to guests. Oboshi married Ozegya in Keana at 10am and Akoshe in Obi at 12 noon on March 28. All three posed with a single cake for photographs as a “triple”. Despite representing his ward, Oboshi claims to be a farmer. Both brides have moved into the same home. ‘What gave me courage to marry two women same day’ Keana: Salt of Nasarawa politics Nasarawa: The limit  of sycophancy
