To mark the 2020 International Women’s Day, the Women Farmers Advancement Network (WOFAN) at the weekend flagged off the distribution of 40 mini rice mills and 40  mini groundnut oil extraction machines to 40 groups of (30 members each)  from  its members spread across Kano, Katsina, Kaduna and Jigawa states. According to the organization, the gesture was aimed at uplifting the beneficiaries’ economic independence and self-reliance in line with the 2020 IWD theme: “I am Generation Equality: Realizing Women’s Rights.” To balance support to the smallholder farmers by gender, WOFAN had earlier extended similar support to male farmers in form of seeds and fertilizers  inputs distribution for 2020 irrigation rice farming reaching about 100 groups of 30 members each from 4 LGAS of Kano. Speaking on the WOFAN intervention, the Founder/Executive Director, Hajia Salamatu Garba, disclosed that the distribution of the items in each of the centres was followed by the beneficiaries’ training on good agricultural practices, group dynamics and good leadership orientation to enable them transparently carry out their daily functions as a cooperative. Hajia Garba informed the beneficiaries of the inputs that WOFAN is working in collaboration with the agricultural agencies and partners such as DDI and USADF to provide them support. She congratulated all women on the commemoration of the International Women Day and wished all men who solidly stand behind their women to ensure their progress greater heights in all their endeavours. The inputs distribution event was attended by traditional leaders, local government representatives and eminent personalities from the benefiting states who converged to celebrate and reflect on way forward with the progress of women and youths in Nigeria.
