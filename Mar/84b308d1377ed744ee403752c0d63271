The management of Media Trust Limited, publishers of Daily Trust titles, yesterday sensitised its staff on the coronavirus pandemic. The company’s Chief Executive Officer, Malam Mannir Dan Ali, told the staff not to panic, expressing optimism that just like the Ebola Virus Disease, “this too shall pass.” He said: “We already have sanitizers for use and we’ll be providing thermometers to measure people’s temperature before they gain entrance to our office. A doctor with the Clearline Health Management Organisation, Oluwatosin Adu, stressed the need for people to protect themselves against coronavirus. He listed the symptoms as including cough, fever, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, body weakness, among others. He asked people to contact their doctors when they noticed any of the symptoms. “Prevention is better than cure. Wash your hands, salute from afar, use hand sanitizer, wear face mask, maintain social distances, especially when you know that people are not feeling fine,” he advised. The head of the Health Desk, Daily Trust, Ojoma Akor, dismissed the rumour that Africans were immune to the virus.
