The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has called for calm after one of its prominent social media crew members, Ukashatu Abubakar Gusau, was arrested and sent to the Nigerian Correctional Service Earlier, two top members of the party, former commissioner of Education, Alhaji Ibrahim Dan Maliki Gidan Goga and former commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Muhammad Dankande Gamji, were arrested and jailed. They were however granted bail after spending about two months in the Nigerian Correctional Service. Addressing newsmen, the party chairman in the state, Alhaji Lawali M. Liman, said the state Shari’a courts should not be dancing to the tune of those in authority, describing the situation as unfortunate. He said the arrested and jailed members were denied bail despite efforts by their lawyers. “This is a democracy; every good citizen of the country is free to express his opinions. Former governor Abdulaziz Yari had never arrested or jailed anyone because of a dissenting political opinion. He tolerated the opposition to the admiration of every one,” Liman said. He said in line with President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government on the need for all and sundry to respect the rule of law, “we call on the government, security agencies, especially the police, the media, civil society organizations and other democratic institutions to note the illegal actions of the Zamfara State PDP-led government.” It could be recalled that Gidan Goga, who is Zamfara State’s APC Publicity Committee secretary, was in November last year arraigned before  the Upper Shari’a Court in Gusau on charges bordering on defamation of character of Governor Bello Matawalle as well as inciting public disturbance. Gamji, on the other hand is facing charges of alleged conspiracy, aiding and abetting.  Zamfara: Gov.
