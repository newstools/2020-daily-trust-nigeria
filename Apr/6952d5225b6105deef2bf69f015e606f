The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe State has started moves to reconcile members of the party after a rift that led to the reported expulsion of Usman Bello Kumo, the member representing Akko Federal Constituency at the National Assembly. Chairman of Kumo East Ward Musa Barade announced the expulsion of Rep Kumo from the party, citing anti-party activities and disrespect to Senator Muhammad Danjuma Goje. In a move to avert the crisis that threatened the peaceful atmosphere in the party, the state chairman, Mr Nitte Amangal, has directed all the members involved in the crisis to desist from commenting on the issue in the media. Daily Trust gathered that Mr Amangal had after an emergency meeting with executives of the party directed all parties involved in the crisis to stop commenting for or against the matter that led to the failed expulsion of the lawmaker. Sources confided to our reporter that during the meeting, Amangal faulted the expulsion of Kumo from the party, saying it was against the constitution of the party. “He also told us that a committee will be inaugurated soon to resolve all the differences and other misunderstandings between the aggrieved members of the party,” the source said.
