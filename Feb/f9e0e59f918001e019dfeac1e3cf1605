The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State has called on the Senate Minority Leader, Sen.  Eyinnaya Abaribe, to seek forgiveness from God over his call on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign. Ekiti State APC Chairman Paul Omotoso, who spoke at Saint James’ Anglican Church, described the comment as not only political and sentimental, but that it failed in rational thinking. “To me and many Nigerians, President Buhari is a godsend. For anybody to say he should resign, that person must ask for forgiveness from God,” he said.
