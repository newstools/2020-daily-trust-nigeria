A former Executive Director, Media Affairs to Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Prince John Maiyaki, has said the plan by a former speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Kabiru Adjoto, to release a documentary exposing the “dark side” of Oshiomhole when he was governor is an attempt to curry Governor Godwin Obaseki’s favour. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) had on Monday quoted Adjoto as saying he was ready to release the three-hour documentary “exposing the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole’s dark waters.” Maiyaki, in a statement yesterday, said Adjoto’s devotion to Obaseki is “driven by an opportunity to extract funds from a desperate man willing to do anything and a crippling fear of life outside of government protection”. He said, “there is a contest amongst the leeches and hangers-on of the embattled Godwin Obaseki on who will get the fattest share of the illegal cake the governor has declared for anyone willing to trade his voice, dignity and reputation by lowering into the septic tank, alongside roaches and other earthly scums, to swim in dirt and rub same on other people as they try, fruitlessly so, to bargain for another four years after a previous one of no show…. “Eventually, appointed as a Special Adviser, he found succour in the cabinet of Obaseki, that gathering of men with questionable characters.” Oshiomhole faces fresh trouble in Edo APC Ex-Speaker vows to lead ‘Oshiomhole-Must-Go protest’ Edo 2020: Issues as fight over ticket gets messier
