The Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier-General Shuaibu Ibrahim, says NYSC orientation camps are ready for use as isolation centres for coronavirus cases. Speaking in Abuja yesterday when he inspected the Federal Capital Territory orientation camp, Ibrahim noted that the use of orientation camps as isolation centres was a directive from the federal government which has to be adhered to. He said it was an indication of the government’s concern for the welfare for Nigerians. The NYSC boss said after the pandemic, the camps would be fumigated. He urged corps members to stay safe and follow all government’s directives. He also asked them to monitor all the social media handles of the scheme for updates on decisions by the management of the scheme.
