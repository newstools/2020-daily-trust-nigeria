A former Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE), Prof. Peter N. Lassa, at the weekend, said in order to address the problem of incompetent teachers, there is the need for the conversion of the Federal College of Education (FCE), Zaria, and some premier Colleges of Education to universities. Prof. Lassa made this known during the third combined convocation ceremony of FCE Zaria where he received an award of excellence. Addressing the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, Prof Lassa said, “Honourable minister, sir, I would like you to take this message to the government. Please we want these colleges, especially the premier Colleges of Education, to become teachers’ universities where only people that have desire for teaching would come. FCE Zaria, Alvan Ikoku, Adeyemi College of Education and FCE Akoka should be considered first. “If we don’t teach our children properly, things would continue to be corrupt in Nigeria. Those who should head institutions like FCE Zaria should be those that have registered with the Teachers’ Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN); not just picking anybody to head teacher-training institutions. Education is the foundation for everything. Therefore, those coming to Colleges of Education should be given bursary awards for encouragement.” Minister calls for dedication as FCE Zaria turns varsity We need curriculum that allows teachers study choice courses – Prof. Shafi’u Accolades as FCE Zaria gets accreditation for all NCE courses
