After the usual temperature screening by officials of the Port Health Services, they were led into luxurious buses which took them to the isolation centers already prepared for them. However, some of them were airlifted to Abuja on an Air Peace flight while they would be quarantined in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Officials of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC), the Lagos State government and other officials of the federal government were on ground to receive them. The same aircraft which brought them repatriated 215 British nationals from the airport.
