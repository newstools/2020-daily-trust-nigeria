The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has warned petroleum products marketers in Bayelsa State against fuel hoarding and increase in price due to the closure of inter-state borders by the government in its efforts to prevent further spread of the coronavirus pandemic nationwide. The Department’s Operational Controller in charge of Yenagoa field office, Mr. George Ene-Ita, told Daily Trust in Yenagoa on Monday that the inter-state border closure order did not affect the movement of petroleum products into the state. He said any dealer found to be selling the product above the N125 government approved price is violating the government directive and he/she is liable for sanction by the DPR. According to him, the surveillance team of the office has always been on the street checking any dealer that default the government directive. He said: “The law and regulation does not change, the pump price for PMS is N125 per litre, anybody who attempt to sell a litre of petrol one Naira above that price is in violation and once that happens, the penalties are clear; we will shut down the filling station for a minimum period of six months in the first place, and the person pays the fine of one hundred thousand Naira per pump. “Then hoarding is even worse than price hike, its attracts a stiffer penalty than violating the pump price, because that is racketeering, that is economic sabotage, if that happens, the person concerned can go to jail. “We are very serious about implementing the changes, we are always on surveillance, to enforce compliance”, Ene-Ita maintained.
