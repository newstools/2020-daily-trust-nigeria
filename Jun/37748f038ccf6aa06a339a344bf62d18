Governor Babajide O. Sanwo-Olu has approved the conduct of year 2020 biometric verification of pensioners tagged “I am Alive” virtually (online) in line with government’s efforts to reduce the effect of COVlD-19 pandemic in the state and ensure physical distancing. The Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Mrs. Ajibola Ponnle told newsmen in Lagos that the verification exercise would represent a departure from the usual one where pensioners are expected to be physically present at their respective local government areas for verification. According to her, the online biometric verification exercise will be done in the Civil Service Pensions Office with verification of all pensioners in batches of local governments and local council development areas as selected staff will be assigned to conduct online interviews from allocated telepoints or telecentres within the office for respective pensioners based on their LGAs. She stressed that the use of technology will form an integral part of the year 2020 biometric verification exercise with the use of Zoom/Skype or any of the Cloud ICT applications to replace the usual physical appearance of pensioners.
