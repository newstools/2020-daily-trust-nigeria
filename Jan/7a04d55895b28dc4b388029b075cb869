Business of winter clothes is booming in Jos, the capital of Plateau State due to the low in temperature that makes the city and its environs coldest in the country since last week. Sellers of jackets, sweaters, hats, scarves, sucks and gloves across the state capital are witnessing huge sales as residents are trooping into major selling points on daily basis to patronise the clothes and warm themselves. A correspondent, who visited Laranto and Terminus markets, where second-hand clothes are hugely sold, witnessed how both wholesalers and retailers are enjoying the cold season from the increase in their sales. At the Terminus Market, retailers from Ahmadu Bello Way down to First Bank and Murtala Muhammed Way seen displaying different clothing bales of jacket, sweaters, gloves  and  hats for customers to make their choice. Dauda Muhammad Ibrahim, the chairman of second-hand clothes dealers at Terminus market said at every cold season, customers usually shifted from patronising other categories of clothes to winter clothes because they prefer to worm their body than to buy clothes meant for fashion. Ibrahim however said, “The fact that there is high demand of winter clothes, the price doesn’t change from the time when the demand was low. We don’t increase the price. Apart from jackets and other winter clothes, all other heavy clothes that warm body are also patronised.” Adamu Muhammad Aliyu, a dealer in the business who also  confirmed the boom in the business. “Winter clothes are bringing money due to the cold weather. Your gain in the business depends on your capital. Those that have invested largely gain more. The truth is that we are enjoying the business at the moment.” JUST IN: Jos warm clothes dealers hike prices as harmattan bites Jos residents lament biting cold, spend more hours indoors Jos: A tourist city in decline, disrepair
