 Men of the Rapid Response Squad of the Lagos State Police Command on Wednesday night rescued a yet-to-be-identified young man, who was said to have alighted from an Uber taxi on the Third Mainland Bridge and jumped into the lagoon with a view to committing suicide. The suicide attempt came two weeks after another young man, Daibo Davies, alighted from an Uber cab on the same Third Mainland Bridge and jumped into the lagoon, committing suicide. The RRS, in a Twitter post yesterday, stated that the cab driver had suspected his passenger was up to something untoward when he was urging him to stop the car on the bridge. The police unit quoted the driver as saying, “On getting to the bride, he asked me whether this was the Third Mainland Bridge and I answered yes. He told me that he was pressed and I should stop for him to ease himself. I was curious. At this time, he was forcing me to stop. “I stylishly drove him to the point where the Rapid Response Squad men were standing, inward Lagos. I practically told him I was no longer interested in the trip before I approached the police officers, leaving him inside the car. “Before he jumped, one of the police officers who saw him approached the railings of the bridge and began persuading him not to jump.” But the man was said to have jumped into the lagoon. However, instead of landing right into the water, he landed onto some floating logs. He was immediately rescued. The RRS said the man was thereafter taken to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, from where he was referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos. “The incident was reported at the Adekunle Police Station, Yaba,” the RRS stated.
