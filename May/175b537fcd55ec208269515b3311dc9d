A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Ghali Na’Abba, has debunked reports insinuating that he died of COVID-19. Na’Abba, who spoke in a video sent to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Kano, dismissed the report as misleading. He said he was still in good health since he visited the UK in the past four weeks. “I am doing this video in order to prove to Nigerians and the world that I am alive, hale and hearty. I am a proud Nigerian and saddened that rumours spread about me in such an evil manner. “However, this is not a time to reprimand anybody, I have been a friend to the press and I believe we should do whatever it is to ensure that we live well among ourselves.
