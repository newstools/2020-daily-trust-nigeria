Former member of the House of Representatives, Ladi Adebutu, yesterday lampooned the leadership of the ninth National Assembly over N37billion budgeted for the renovation of the assembly complex. Adebutu, who represented Remo federal constituency in the eight assembly, said the leadership of National Assembly under Senate President Ahmed Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila was brilliantly constituted but expressed regret that the legislature had become an “appendage” of President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. He spoke while responding to questions from journalists in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during the end-of-year-party organized by a faction of the PDP in the state. Adebutu, who was the gubernatorial aspirant of the PDP in 2019, also branded the current legislature as a department of the ruling APC. The former legislator who equally described Lawan and Gbajabiamila – led National Assembly as a rubber stamp, saying such assembly “ultimately fails and it has started failing.” Adebutu also bemoaned the nation’s debt profile, describing it as painful and unbearable. Also speaking, the factional State Chairman of the party, Sikirulai Ogundele, expressed worry over the forthcoming local government election in the State, stressing that the party has no confidence in the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission (OGISEC) in conducting a credible, free and fair election. Ogundele said the PDP might boycott the election, alleging that OGISEC is an extension of the APC-led administration in the State. He insisted that the party would only participate in the election if it was conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
