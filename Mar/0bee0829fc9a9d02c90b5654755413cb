The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena yesterday enforced a court order stopping the spokesman of the party from parading himself as a member of the National Working Committee (NWC). The National Vice Chairman (North West) of the party, Inuwa Abdulkadir, had on March 13, 2020, obtained an order of a Sokoto High Court restraining the party from appointing or electing “Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu or any member” into its top positions except through a national convention. Nabena locked up the office of Lanre Issa-Onilu, the national publicity secretary at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. On arrival at the party’s office, Nabena went straight to the office of Issa-Onilu, located on the first floor of the building and locked it up. It could be recalled that Nabena had on Sunday issued a statement declaring himself as the spokesman of the party following a court order against Issa-Onilu. When Daily Trust tried to approach him, after he had locked the office and was returning to his car, he said he will return to address the press on the issue later.
