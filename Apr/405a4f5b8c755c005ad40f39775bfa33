The members of the COVID-19 enforcement task team have cleared shanties and illegal shops located at the Kuje forest market and tipper garage in the area. The chairman of the enforcement task team in the area, Sunday Zaka, while addressing newsmen yesterday, said the exercise was aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus. He also said the clearing was to decongest traffic at the Kuje main market, which he said is caused by roadside traders in the area. According to him, the area council enforcement task team had at a meeting with members of the market union issued an ultimatum for them to remove all the makeshift shops and kiosks erected by the roadside. “Despite the ultimatum given to them to remove their kiosks, some of them refused. So the next thing is to pull them down,” he said. Zaka, pointed out that the multiple shops outside the market and corridor of the main market are sources of concern and also a security threat to the lives of residents of the area.
