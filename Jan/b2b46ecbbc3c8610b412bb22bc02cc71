A house wife has sued her husband at an Upper Area Court sitting in Jiwa, Abuja, for allegedly not granting her menstrual leave. The woman (name withheld) who lives in Gwagwa had approached the court to dissolve her three-year-old marriage with her husband. She accused her husband of not granting her menstrual leave as enshrined in the Muslim marriage law, which commands the couple to abstain from sexual intercourse, in addition to excusing the woman from participating in other devotions, such as five daily prayers and fasting. The woman told the court that her husband, Khalid Idris, demands sex from her even while she is impure, and also forces her to observe the five daily obligatory prayers. Idris, however, denied demanding sex but admitted to forcing her to observe the prayers. The judge, Muhammad B. Marafa, who had asked the couple to bring their respective guardians during yesterday’s hearing,  adjourned the case to February 13.
