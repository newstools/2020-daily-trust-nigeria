The FCT Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Ayuba Wobin Gora, said 45 motorists were arrested for overloading during the enforcement of social distancing protocol. The Federal capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has placed restriction on number of residents at worship centres, social gatherings and has emphasized the importance of social distancing as part of measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Gora, while speaking with our reporter in Abuja yesterday, said 25 motorists were arrested within the city while 15 others were arrested along Dutsen Alhaji axis. He said all the motorists arrested for overloading will not only be fined and released, but “they must also go and do emotional evaluation and bring the test result before his vehicle will be released,” he said. He said with the advent of the coronavirus, the sector had to step up its enforcement of overloading by motorists across the territory. He said the issue of overloading has always been on the front burner, saying the sector would not relent in seeing that motorists stop carrying overload. “I expected that with the coronavirus pandemic, motorists would not carry overload. They should know that this disease is by contact and there is no way you will carry overload and you will not have contact with other passengers,” he said. According to him, there was the need for motorists, especially commercial drivers,  to learn how to ensure safety of their passengers, saying there was the need for them to see the outbreak of the virus as a wildfire.  65 arrested as FRSC commences yuletide patrol on Abuja-Lokoja road FRSC arraigns 114, convicts 97 over traffic offences 81 drivers convicted for traffic offences in Kaduna
