The National Pensions Commission (PenCom) has alerted all employees in Nigeria that they have right to pension contributions and Life Insurance Policy from their employers. A statement released yesterday by PenCom indicated that employers are mandated under Section 4(5) of the Pension Reform Act, 2014 (PRA, 2014) to put in place Life Insurance Policy for their employees for an insured amount of not less than three times their annual total emolument. “Employees are also required to ensure that all pension contributions deducted from salaries and/or contributed by employers are remitted to the Pension Fund Custodian (PFC) by the Employer not later than seven working days from the date of payment of their salaries,” the Commission said. PenCom advised employees to report to the Commission where the employer fails to procure the minimum required Life Insurance Policy in their favour; submit the evidence of compliance with Life Insurance Policy to the Commission; place the certificate in a conspicuous place within the organisation and remit the deducted pension contributions into their Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs).
