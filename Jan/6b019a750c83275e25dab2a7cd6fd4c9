A chieftain of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) in Nasarawa State, Ibrahim Mohammed Hamza, has decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Hamza was once a member of Nasarawa State House of Assembly who represented Lafia Central from 2003 to 2007 on the platform of National Democratic Party (NDP). While speaking on the reasons why he left APGA for PDP, the former lawmaker said, “I left APGA for PDP because it does not have state spread, which is a defect to any political party. I joined the PDP because of its past record in the state as it has set the foundation for the infrastructural development of the state.” He said that he and about 3,000 of his supporters joined the PDP because the ruling All Progressives Congress lacked development ideals, stating the party has failed to develop the state with the resources at its disposal.
