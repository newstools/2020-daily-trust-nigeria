Three persons died yesterday while some others were injured in an accident involving an articulated truck at Charity bus stop, on the Oshodi-Mile 2 expressway. The incident caused a serious traffic hold-up on the expressway, outward Oshodi to Mile 2. Our correspondent learnt that two of the deceased persons were construction workers on the Oshodi-Mile 2 expressway. A trader at Mile 2, Mike Ohachi, who told Daily Trust he witnessed the accident, said the driver of the truck was over-speeding when its brakes failed and the driver veered into the service lane, crushing the two construction workers and one bystander.

Unfortunately, the median could not stop the truck and he rammed into people,” Ohachi narrated. The witness said the driver was rescued by policemen from the Makinde police station, Oshodi. “Other construction workers and urchins who were at the scene descended on the driver of the truck, while his conductor escaped. But the driver was rescued by a team of policemen who were on patrol of the area,” he said. Our correspondent made efforts to get an update on the accident yesterday evening from the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, but was unsuccessful as the PPRO was said to be in a meeting.
