Speaker of Imo State House of Assembly  Chiji Collins has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Daily Trust reports that with the defections, APC now has two-third majority of 18 lawmakers, PDP eight and Uju Onwudiwe of Action Alliance (AA) who was declared winner of the supplementary election held Saturday but is yet to be inaugurated. The lawmakers announced their defection when they resumed sitting after a one-week break. The gale of defections rocking the parliament might not be unconnected with the sacking of Emeka Ihedioha of PDP and declaration of APC’s Hope Uzodinma as governor of the state. It could be recalled that shortly after the 2019 general elections, he dumped the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA)  for the PDP to enable him to emerge as the speaker after the position was zoned to Okigwe His defection to APC, according to political watchers, is to enable him to retain his position. The speaker announced his defection and that of his seven colleagues during plenary on Tuesday. The plenary, which lasted for 15 minutes, was adjourned after the speaker announced the defection. Those who joined the speaker were Uche Ogbuagu (Ikeduru), Dominic Ezerioha (Oru west) Chigozie Nwaneri (Oru East), Kanayo Onyemaechi (Owerri West), Kennedy Ibe (Obowo) Onyemaechi Njoku (Ihitte/Uboma) and Eddy Obinna (Aboh Mbaise) equally defected. Obinna represents Emeka Ihedioha’s local government After announcing their defection, the house adjourned sitting to Thursday. Last week, nine of the lawmakers dumped their parties for APC.
