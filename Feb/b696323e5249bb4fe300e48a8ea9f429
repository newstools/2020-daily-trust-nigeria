The 89th Emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday  failed to give directives to the National Working Committee (NWC) to file for the review of judgement of the Supreme Court on presidential election. It however constituted a 14-man committee to review the 2019 general election. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan told newsmen few days ago in Abuja, that following the APC’s return to the apex court for a review of the Bayelsa and Zamfara states governorship election judgements, the PDP would seek a review of the presidential election verdict. But NEC which is the second-higest decision making organ of the party which was to approve the NWC’s position at its meeting yesterday failed to do so on grounds that the facts and evidence concerning the judgements must be meticulously studied. Addressing newsmen at the end of the meeting which lasted for about two hours at the party’s headquarters, Ologbondiyan simply said, “NEC has  agreed to approach other concerns in relation to elections and weight of evidence.” He however, parried a question on when the party would file for a review of the judgement at the apex court.
