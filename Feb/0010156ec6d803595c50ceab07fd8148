The Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola, has commissioned a new Chief Magistrate court in Ire Ekiti, Oye Local Government Area of the state. Justice Daramola, in his inauguration speech, described the commissioning as another fulfilment of the incumbent administration to bring justice nearer to the people of the state. The judge implored the community to make maximum use of the court, saying doing so was better than taking the law into their hands in resolving disputes. In his speech, the traditional ruler of the community, the Onire of Ire-Ekiti, Oba Bobade Adeleke, thanked Justice Daramola for personally gracing the occasion and assured him that he would work closely with the police and also monitor the administration of cases at the police station to ensure quick dispensation of justice within a reasonable period.
