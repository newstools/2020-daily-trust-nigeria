The police in Lagos yesterday took a 23-year-old man, Ebuka Augustine, before a Yaba chief magistrate court for allegedly uploading a nude video of a 13-year-old girl online. The police said that Augustine, who the police described as a co-tenant with the girl’s parents in the Alaba, Ojo, area of Lagos, lured the teenager into his room, where he allegedly defiled her and recorded her nudity in the process. The police alleged that the defendant posted the video to her school friends and also shared it on social media, while tagging the girl’s mother to watch. “The accused used his phone to record the act. He started by extorting the girl, but later sent the video to her mother,” the police said.
