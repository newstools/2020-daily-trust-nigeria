The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) is supporting the manufacturing and importation of essential materials with the adoption of International Organisation for Standardisation-approved 28 international standards to aid their operations as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads further. One of the standards adopted from the African Organisation for Standardisation (ARSO) on alcohol-based hand sanitizers. A statement issued by the Director General, Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Osita Aboloma, indicated that the adoption of the standards is to meet emergency needs occasioned by COVID-19 globally while the process for the adoption would continue unhindered in spite of the lockdown. The standards, which are being provided at no cost to local manufacturers, are being made available to the National Committee on Sustainable Production and Delivery of Essential Commodities during the COVID-19 Pandemic of which SON is a member. According to the DG, the measure is to guide local manufacturers as well as provide a benchmark for adjudging all imported products in the category during the pandemic. He hinted that the standardization agency had received free, unlimited usage of the ISO web conferencing system (Zoom) for national standards development work only. “With this offer, Nigeria as an eligible member will be assigned a Zoom account for developing countries, which we can share with our Technical Committee (TC) members and experts, creating the equivalent of a ‘virtual conference room’ at the national level”, Aboloma clarified. He explained that with the offer, Nigeria’s TC meetings could continue largely, while its stakeholders and experts keep safe in this time of bans on gatherings and travels. Aboloma charged the TC members to expect invitations from the Secretariat for participation in the consideration and adoption of several international standards from ISO resources, to support global efforts in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.
