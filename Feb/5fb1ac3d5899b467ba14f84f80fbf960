The Catholic Archbishop of Owerri, Most Rev. Anthony Obinna, has said that the recent Supreme Court judgement has created a state of confusion in Imo State. Obinna, who expressed his worry while delivering his homily at Maria Assumpta Cathedral Church yesterday, noted that the judgment of the apex court which removed Emeka Ihedioha and declared Hope Uzodinma as governor had created confusion and given rise to series of protests by citizens. According to him, but for Imo people being law-abiding, and optimistic of something positive coming from the review of the judgment by the Supreme Court to reflect their voting at the March governorship election, they would have embarked on activities detrimental to the peace of the state. The archbishop bemoaned the actions of members of the state House of Assembly whom he described as “colourless politicians”, lamenting how some of them abandoned the political platform they were elected and switched over to another party because of greed and selfishness. Meanwhile, a former governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA) in the 2019 election in Imo State, Ugwumba Uche Nwosu, has backed Governor Hope Uzodinma against claims that senior staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (NEC) serving in the Southeast compromised their duties in the 2019 general election in the state to support him.
