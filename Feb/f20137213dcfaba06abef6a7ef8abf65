The All Progressives Congress (APC) youths in Ogun State yesterday commemorated February 11, the day President Muhammadu Buhari and other top APC members were pelted at a campaign rally in Abeokuta, the state capital. Daily Trust recalls that the 2019 APC presidential rally held at the MKO Stadium, Abeokuta, ended in a fiasco when hoodlums pelted dignitaries including Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, former Lagos governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu among others. Exactly one year after the political drama, some youths under the aegis of APC Youth League marked the February 11, 2019 scenario with a demonstration tagged “Ogun Freedom Walk 2020.” Hundreds of youths, carrying placards with different inscriptions, participated in the walk which took them through some major streets in the state capital. Some of the inscriptions read “Freedom From Do or Die Politics.” Speaking with newsmen, Special Assistant to the Governor on Youth Affairs, Olamide Lawal, said the walk was organised as a mark of departure from politics of bitterness which characterized the last election in the state.
