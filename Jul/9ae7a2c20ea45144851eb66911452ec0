A former Senate Leader, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, has called on elders of Cross River State to begin work now on who will succeed Governor Ben Ayade in 2023. He has also canvassed an end to the rotation of governorship amongst the three senatorial districts in the state. Ndoma-Egba who spoke in Calabar, insisted that zoning system did not bring out the best of candidates. The former federal lawmaker, who represented Cross River Central Senatorial District thrice until 2015, also said that the rotational governorship had not allowed for effective and efficient governance because a more competent person may not emerge from where the governorship is zoned. “Senior citizens and elders of our state should come together with a view to sourcing for a capable replacement for Governor Ayade in 2023. We cannot afford this zoning system any further,” he said. Ndoma-Egba advised members of his new party, the APC, to eschew bitterness and division as they cannot make an impact if they are not united.
