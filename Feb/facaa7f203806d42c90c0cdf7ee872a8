An industrial action looms in the Federal Capital Territory Administration over delayed and part payment of some workers’ salaries. It comes as the Association of Resident Doctors raised concerns that workers’ salaries for January 2020 were delayed, and then paid eight weeks later with a reduction between one-fifth to one-tenth. The association said workers in health and education secretariats were worst hit. The FCTA attributed the delay to technical issues as it migrates onto the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPS) following directives by the federal government. “IPPIS has been the platform for salary payment for over six years with the recognition of the various salary structures,” Dr Roland Aigbovo, said in a statement. “It really beats my imagination why at this time, this grievous mistake will still be made after the long wait. “Many workers have been left in a very depressing mood with the turn of events as regards their salaries which they were anxiously waiting for to ease the financial burden following the end of year and new year celebrations,” he added. He said the situation has brought to light the fact that some workers are being owed up to seven months, adding that the IPPIS excuse will further cause hardship for workers.
