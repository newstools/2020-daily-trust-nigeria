Ms Yousafzai moved to Britain after being shot in the head by a Taliban hitman for campaigning for girls’ education in Pakistan in 2012. And after being flown to Britain for life-saving medical treatment, the family settled in Birmingham, central England. She was at school there when she heard in 2014 that she had won the Nobel Peace Prize along with Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi “for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.” Malala first rose to prominence aged just 11 with a blog for the BBC’s Urdu-language service charting her life in Swat under the Taliban. The youngest-ever Nobel laureate, she has continued to speak out for girls’ education. She studied politics, philosophy, and economics at Lady Margaret Hall.
