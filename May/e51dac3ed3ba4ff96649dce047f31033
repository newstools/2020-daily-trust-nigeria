Nigerians have been urged to render support to those in the frontline of checking the spread of COVID-19, including security agents. The Chairman of the FCT chapter of the Association of Licensed Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria (ALPSPN), Retired Commissioner of Police, Barr. Lawrence Alobi, made the call yesterday in Abuja, while donating face masks to the FCT commands of the police, State Security Services (SSS) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). Barr. Alobi said the gesture was part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of ALPSPN, in supporting security agencies, especially as they take up a new role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. He said, “While everyone is mandated to wear a face mask as part of measures to check the spread of COVID-19, those who enforce the measures to check the spread must also be protected.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
