The Osun State government has commenced reconstruction of the Atakumosa market, which was recently destroyed by fire, with the governor, Mr Gboyega Oyetola, disclosing he had raised N200 million for the project. Traders, whose shops and stores were destroyed by the fire, had lamented they were displaced and that the incident had blocked their means of livelihood. Oyetola told them that the money for the reconstruction of the market was ready and it would be completed within two months. The governor explained that the state government raised N100m and that the World Bank, through the Osun Agency for Community and Social Development (CSDP), contributed the other N100m to rebuild the market. He said 400 shops and stores that would meet modern standard with toilets and boreholes would be built and completed in the first phase of the project. The General Manager, Osun-CSDP, Mrs Aderonke Funmi Abokede, said the CSDP support to the state was to alleviate the suffering of the vulnerable residents and make life better for them. Abokede said when the market was completed, benefiting traders would be able to trade and generate wealth, thereby curbing poverty in the state.
