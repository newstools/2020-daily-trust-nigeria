The All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State are trading blame over the palliative measures put in place by the state government to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. While APC is commending the measures put in place to combat the pandemic, the opposition party thumped down the state government. The Publicity Secretary of the party, Ade Ajayi, commended Governor Kayode Fayemi for the distribution of food and stimulus packages to 20,000 people in the state. But PDP Publicity Secretary Jackson Adebayo condemned the measures, saying “what the APC is doing is politically motivated in giving out the coronavirus palliative measures in the state. Adebayo said there is no humanitarian face in the order of distribution, noting that the governor distributed the palliatives through local government chairmen in the state.
