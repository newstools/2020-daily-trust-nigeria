A former Governor of Ekiti State, Engr. Segun Oni, says he is leaving the All Progressives Congress (APC) due to shabby treatment being meted to him and his supporters in the party. According to Oni, he had commenced the process of meeting with critical stakeholders in the Ekiti Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), like former governor Ayodele Fayose and Senator Biodun Olujimi about his resolve to return to his former party. “I took the decision to return to PDP as a way of acceding to the request of my people, who are desirous of taking the political step,” he said. Oni, who defected to APC in June 2014 and held the position of deputy national chairman, was planning to return to the PDP, where he started as a foundation member and a governor. The former governor, while speaking in a telephone conversation with newsmen yesterday in Ado Ekiti, expressed his displeasure over the way he and his supporters were being ostracised from all engagements in APC, including appointments and privileges to contest elections. He said: “You all know the kind of treatment I have been getting. As we speak, none of my supporters has been allowed to get appointment or contest election in APC. “If the APC gives me the whole world, I won’t be happy seeing integral part of my political life, I mean my supporters, being treated badly. Oni, however did not give the actual time he will formally join the PDP.  “We have taken a decision and we are at the process of joining PDP. We are going to set up implementation committee to work on our programme of actions.” Oni said he is ready to work with other major stakeholders in the PDP, in his quest to return to the party.
