A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ibrahim Jirgi, has said the leadership style of the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has brought sanity to the administration of the national capital. Ibrahim, who spoke in an interview with Daily Trust, said corruption was endemic in the previous administrations of the FCTA, but that the prudent style of managing resources the incumbent minister had deployed had brought a lot of changes to the system. He said, “We are all aware of how things deteriorated in the administration of the FCT and we are also witnesses to how bad doing business there was. “But I must acknowledge that since the assumption of office of the current FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, we have seen how his style of leadership has changed the narrative. There is sanity in all facets there and it is no longer business as usual for corrupt elements who have cashed in on the loopholes to make things difficult for everyone, but themselves.”  A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ibrahim Jirgi, has said the leadership style of the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has brought sanity to the administration of the national capital.
