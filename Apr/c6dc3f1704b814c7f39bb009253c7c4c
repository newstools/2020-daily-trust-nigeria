Hundreds of Americans who were scheduled to be evacuated from Nigeria on Friday were stranded for hours at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, Lagos when the aircraft which was to convey them did not arrive, Daily Trust on Saturday has learnt. 4,000 United Kingdom citizens in the country have reportedly applied to be evacuated back to their home country. The Americans whose number could not be ascertained eventually left the airport frustrated for their respective homes and hotels. It was learnt that the chartered flight to be operated by Omni Air International which was coming from Dulles Airport could not land in Nigeria due to over flight issues with other countries. Most of the evacuees were reportedly wearing sad faces when they were told that the evacuation flight from Dulles may not be on ground on Friday. The US nationals who had already checked-in by authorities at the airport were seen collecting their baggage from the arrival baggage belts with the plan to go back home. They eventually left the airport when it was clear the aircraft might not arrive after hours of waiting. According to investigation, the flight was cancelled due to the inability of the airplane to over-fly some countries, though the countries could not be ascertained as of press time.
