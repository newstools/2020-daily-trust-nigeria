The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has donated N200 million to the Abule Ado/Soba Emergency Relief Fund set up by Lagos State. Chairman of the NGF, Governor Kayode Fayemi disclosed this when he led the delegation, comprising his colleagues from Edo, Godwin Obaseki and Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje, to the site of the incident in Lagos. Fayemi expressed surprise at the level of destruction, noting that more lives would have been lost if there was no prompt response. The Ekiti State governor said the N200m donation was meant to cushion the effect of the loss by the victim. The NGF chairman blamed the explosion on the disagreement between states and the Federal Government on the ownership of land. While commending the Lagos State Government for the attention given to the place, he promised that such issues would be addressed going forward. He also commended the state government for the decision to take action and ensure that the issue of building on pipeline corridors are averted. The governors commiserated with those who lost loved ones and properties  in the unfortunate incident. Also in the delegation were the director-general of the NGF, Asishana Okauru and the head, of Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo.
