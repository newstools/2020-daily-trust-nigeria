The Ibadan family heads, otherwise known as the Authentic Mogajis, yesterday explained why they spoke on the crisis rocking the Ekiti State Traditional Council and proposed a visit to the deposed Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. The Mogajis said through their spokesman, Wale Oladoja, that while their proposed visit to Sanusi was in solidarity with him, their concern in Ekiti State was to ensure that the traditional institution in the Southwest, was not brought down. The family heads were reacting to a statement credited to a group called ‘Omo Ibile Ibadan’, which condemned both the Mogaji’s proposed visit to the deposed Emir of Kano and comments on 11 traditional rulers that the governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi, queried. In their statement, the Authentic Mogajis maintained that they were not intervening in politics or any other matter that they were less concerned about but in issues that could undermine the  traditional institution in Nigeria. They faulted the group’s call on the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, to caution them for commenting on issues concerning the traditional institution, saying that the Olubadan appreciates the traditional institution and knows it must be protected. The family heads further said they were not unaware of the “machinations of the people hiding behind a finger to discredit the good names and hard-earned reputation of the respected Mogajis in Ibadanland”, adding that they would react to them appropriately. “Our statement was to corroborate the letter written by our father, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, on the need to protect our exalted stool and the traditional institutions in the country. We know the people behind the mischievous statement issued to tackle Ibadan Mogajis and we will react to their shenanigans at the right time,” the statement said.
