The Chairman, Muslim Cemeteries Managers Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Abdullahi Mohammed Bida, has asked state governors to follow the footsteps of Zamfara State government in the management and maintenance of cemeteries in the country. Alhaji Abdullahi said the governments should ensure that cemeteries in the state were kept in good condition. The chairman, in a media chat with journalists in Kaduna, said that the current dilapidation of cemeteries in the country called for urgent intervention by state governments and individuals to “provide  fencing, water, security guards, working materials and tools to cemetery workers so as to encourage them. He suggested the appointment of a commissioner to oversee the well-being of cemeteries to ensure that they are safeguarded and maintained appropriately. He appealed to the Chairman of Igabi Local Government, Alhaji Khamis Jibril, and the Muslim Ummah to assist in the rehabilitation of the two cemeteries in the area to save them from present dilapidation.
