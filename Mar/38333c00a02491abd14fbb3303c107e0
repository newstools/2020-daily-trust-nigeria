Justice Ayokunle Faji, sitting at a Federal High Court, Lagos, on Friday convicted a gateman, James Paul Tuksa, for terrorism, threat to life and fraud. Thè court convicted Tuksa, having found him guilty of all the charges preferred again him by the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF). The convict, a gateman at 4a, Ibironke Crescent, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi, was said to have sometime in October 2016 called one Victor Omotayo Awosika, of 2, Ibironke Crescent, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos, on phone, threatening to kill him and his family members, unless he was paid N5 million as ransom. He was also said to have fraudulently stolen the sum of N5m from Awosika. Tuksa was first arraigned before the court on May 25, 2017 on a two-count charge of the offence, which he had pleaded not guilty to. The AGF, through his lawyer, O. C. Anigbogu, however, amended the charge to three counts of the same offences, with the defendant still maintaining his innocence on the charges. During the trial, the prosecutor, Anigbogu, called two witnesses and tendered four exhibits, including the statement of the defendant. Tuksa’s extra-judicial statement and a CCTV footage were tendered by two prosecution’s witnesses respectively. The convict gave evidence in his defence. Justice Ayokunle Faji, while delivering judgment on the charges on Friday, said the prosecution had successfully proven its case against the convict.
