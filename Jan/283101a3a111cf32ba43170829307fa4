President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, First Bank, Dr Adesola Adeduntan, on his award of Distinguished Alumnus of the Year by Cranfield School of Management, United Kingdom. President Buhari, in a statement yesterday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the award is a vote of confidence on Nigerian professionals, many of who rank among the very best in the world. The president said the fact that Cranfield School of Management is giving Adeduntan the award because he “exemplifies the values of the school” and serves as “role model to students and potential students” is an endorsement that should make every Nigerian proud. Adeduntan attended Cranfield School of Management in 2004 as British Chevening Scholar. He is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Banking of Nigeria (CIBN) and Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN).
