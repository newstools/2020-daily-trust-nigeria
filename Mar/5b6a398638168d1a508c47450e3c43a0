AÂ 41-year-old businessman, Anifowose Segun, has appeared before a Grade One Area Court, Karu, Abuja over document forgery and land fraud charges. The defendant was said to have conspired with one Ola Ajibola who is also facing similar charges at the court to defraud the complainant of N1.5million. The prosecution counsel, Adeyanju Atotunde, told the court that the defendant forged land documents and sold three plots of land to the complainant which he later found out were not genuine after entrusting the accused with the money. Adeyanju also informed the court that the defendant was once on police administrative bail but refused to report back to the police station until his surety was arrested. He urged the court to charge the defendant on five count charges of joint act, criminal breach of trust, cheating, criminal misappropriation and failure to attend in obedience to an order promulgated by the public servant contrary to sections 79, 312, 322, 309 and 136 of the Penal Code Law. The defendant who resides at Jikwoyi Phase 1, Abuja, however pleaded not guilty to the charges proffered against him. The Judge, Ismail Abdullahi, refused to grant the defendant bail and ordered him to be remanded at a correctional facility based on the submission of the prosecution counsel that the defendant once jumped bail at Jikwoyi police station, Abuja. The Judge adjourned the case till March 23, 2020.  Man in court over alleged N.8m land fraud Ex-convict in court over burglary charges Police arraign businessman over alleged N3.3m fraud
