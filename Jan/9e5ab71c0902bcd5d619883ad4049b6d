The leader of the Abia State Caucus of the APC, Chief Sam Nkire, has called on all aggrieved persons in the party to sheathe their swords and work for the success of party in the state come 2023. Chief Nkire made the call at a reconciliation meeting held in Aba to reconcile two senatorial candidates, Sir Marc Wabara and Dr Nyerere Anyim who had been at daggers drawn since the last election. According to the Abia State APC Caucus Leader, although the Supreme Court had delivered judgment and concluded the matter, it failed to deliver peace to the APC family until this fateful day. Chief Nkire disclosed that a peace and reconciliation committee would soon be set up to ensure that all cleavages of disunity among members become things of the past. The caucus Leader further appealed to all attack dogs of the various factions or aggrieved personalities to ‘cease fire’ and toe the path of peace.
