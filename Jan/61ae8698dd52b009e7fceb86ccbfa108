Executive Chairman of Langtang North Local Government Council Ubandoman Joshua-Laven of the PDP has described Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong as an honest leader who has continued to ensure the autonomy of local government councils. Laven spoke with newsmen in Jos, the Plateau State capital, on the occasion of his over 100 days in office as well as his reaction to Governor Lalong and APC’s recent election victory at the Supreme Court. The council boss, who is the only PDP chairman in the 17 local government councils of the state (16 are all APC) said the governor has been carrying him along in spite of him being the only opposition party LG boss. “Since I resumed office as the Executive Chairman of Langtang North over a hundred days ago, Governor Lalong has given me free hand to operate. He carries me along despite the fact that I was elected under the platform of the PDP,” he stressed.
