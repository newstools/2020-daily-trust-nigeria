An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti has sentenced a 39-year-old man, Femi Romiluyi, to eight years imprisonment for burglary and stealing. The court yesterday found Romiluyi guilty of burglary and stealing after he confessed to the crimes and the prosecution called witnesses during the trial. The judge, Justice Bamidele Omotosho, however, did not find the defendant guilty of the offence of armed robbery, with which he was also charged. Justice Omotosho noted after listening to both the prosecution and defence counsel that the prosecution had established the case of burglary against Romiluyi beyond reasonable doubt. The judge explained that the court found the accused person guilty as charged on counts three and four for the offences of burglary and stealing, but it was sentencing him to only eight years imprisonment based on the plea of the defence counsel, Lawrence Fasanmi, who described his client as a first-time offender. The prosecution counsel, Mr Abon Akinola, from the Ekiti State Ministry of Justice, told the court that Romiluyi committed the offences on January 11, 2016, while armed with offensive weapons that included a gun, a knife and a cutlass, and robbed one Adeniran Ojumu of his Ipad and MTN recharge cards valued at N30,000. Akinola added that on January 12, 2016 at the Textile area, the defendant also robbed one Pastor Sunday Ariyo of his HP laptops and a sum of N20,000 while armed with offensive weapons. The prosecution called five witnesses and tendered exhibits that included photographs and Romiluyiâ€™s statement. Fasanmi, who called only one witness, pleaded for leniency for his client, saying he was in his prime and could still be useful to the society.  4 men jailed 7 yrs each for theft of cigarettes, others Man, 40, sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for burglary Man, 55, jailed 14yrs for attempted rape of daughter
