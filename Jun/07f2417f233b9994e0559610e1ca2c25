In its effort to look for more ways of generating revenue internally, the Niger State Government has concluded plans to turnaround the Gurara Water Falls, Shiroro Beach and Shagunu Beach to attract tourism. The Niger State Commissioner for Tourism and Culture, Mrs. Rifkatu Adamu Chidawa, disclosed that a South African investor had indicated interest for their development through a Public Private-Partnership (PPP) and under Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis.
