The federal government should introduce policies that will enhance the country’s agricultural export, the Managing Director, Wal-wanne Group, Dr Abiso Kabir has said. Speaking during an interview with journalists yesterday in Abuja, Dr Kabir said the challenges in the sector were daunting including the inability of farmers to efficiently export some of their produce. Dr Kabir said the failure of farmers to meet relevant international requirements on agricultural export relating to the health of plants was a major challenge affecting foreign trade between Nigeria and other countries. “The need to get everybody in agriculture has been one of the cardinal points of the Economic Recovery Growth Plan (ERGP) of the Federal Government with emphasis on developing and export- led economy,” he said. According to him, Wal-wanne Group as an Agro-Allied Company that specialised in mechanised farming, processing, storage and distribution of farm produce in Nigeria, was working to create wealth and job opportunities through agriculture in many communities. Dr Kabir who also spoke on the Wal-wanne rice mill, which produces 120 tons of rice per day, said the firm has been able to create employment opportunities to women and youths. “We created a brand that accommodates the company’s expansion drive into new frontiers. This was visible in the modern, interactive redesign of their branding materials and overall strategic advisory for the business. “With the new mechanisation in agriculture, we have increased output. Some of our products are exportable and there are of high demand, our products are highly nutritional.” “We will continue to showcase agriculture to unemployed youths as an enterprise and the imperative of returning to the farm to guarantee wealth creation and food security,’ he stated.
