Pest control professionals under the auspices of Environmental Preservation Development and Restoration International Organisation (EPDRIO) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) says it is unacceptable that the profession is for ‘all comers.’ President of the association Terungwa Abari, who made this known in Abuja, said pest control in Nigeria is one profession in which the barriers to entry seemed to be lower as practically anybody can wake up and call himself or herself a pest control practitioner or consultant. Abari,  in his acceptance speech as the president of the association after the former chairman, Prince Bisi Gbadebo, stepped down, said he would reform the sector so as to accord the profession its rightful place of honour in the league of other noble professions in Nigeria. He said regulation of pest control activities is poor, minimal and ineffective. “Current efforts are mere enforcement for revenue generation, multiple and high cost of registration. There are only 118 registered companies with EHORECON that are licensed to practice pest control in Nigeria but there are more than 600 so-called pest control companies/operators in the FCT alone,” he said. “I hereby vow that it will not be business as usual for unqualified practitioners who are tarnishing the reputation of the profession through unwholesome practices,” Abari said, adding that he would pursue a seven-point agenda including clearer identity, legislation and stricter enforcement. “The regulatory agencies are there not just to generate revenue but to ensure that the right policies, practices, information and environment are put in place to ensure effective and efficient practice of this profession,” he said.
