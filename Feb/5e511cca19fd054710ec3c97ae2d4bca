The Federal Government is committed to minimum of 70 per cent broadband penetration in Nigeria by 2025, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami has said. Dr Pantami stated this during the visit of Phase 3 Telecoms Limited led by its Executive Chairman Mr. Stanley Jegede at the Ministry’s headquarters in Abuja yesterday. The Minister said that Digital Economy Policy and Strategy for digital Nigeria could not be achieved without broadband penetration in the country. He said:  “Whatever we do we relied so much on broadband penetration. That is why any effort to compliment what we have been doing to ensure broadband penetration, even for one kilometre is highly commendable, we do not undermine it, we really appreciate it”. He said the responsibility of building the ICT sector shouldn’t lie on the government alone, noting that ICT globally are being supported and developed by private sector. Dr Pantami said: “The main responsibility of government is to ensure that the environment is favourable and conducive and if there are any challenges, government will intervene. This is what we will continue to do and I assure you within the time I am going to spend here, I will give 100% to ensure that all the challenges we encounter are addressed”. He said the access gap in Nigeria was worrisome and the need to bridge it could not be over emphasized ‘’ because broadband penetration is directly proportional to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. ‘’ Earlier, the Executive Chairman, Phase 3 Telecoms Limited, Mr. Stanly Jegede commended the Minister on the resolution of the Right of Way (RoW) issues and the way he redirected the focus of the Ministry of Communications to digital economy. FG targets 70% broadband penetration in 5 years Nigeria eyes larger share of $11.5trn global digital economy RoW will not deter us from implementing broadband strategy – FG
