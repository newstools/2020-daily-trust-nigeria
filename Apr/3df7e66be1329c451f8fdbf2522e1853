The factional Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), loyal to Governor Godwin Obaseki, of Edo State, Aslem Ojezua has said the concern of the state government and party at the moment was how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and not politics. Ojezua stated this yesterday while reacting to the comment credited to the factional chairman loyal to the national chairman of the party, Col Davide Imose (rtd), accusing Governor Obaseki of romancing with manufacturers of medical products. “So we would rather concentrate our efforts on getting the people aware of the danger of the pandemic and the need to protect themselves. “We will also focus on how to guide our people out of the economic crisis that may arise from the pandemic at the end of it. These are the areas we will concentrate on and not to play politics at this stage,” he said.
