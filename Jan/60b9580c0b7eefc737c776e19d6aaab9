The Lagos State Police Command has reunited a suspected mentally unstable lady, Chinyere Christopher, with her parents in Akure, Ondo State. Chinyere, according to the police, had been residing in an uncompleted house at Otowolo, Ikorodu. The police said that the mental state of the lady became worrisome when she allegedly took to the street, smashing vehicle windscreens. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the report, said Chinyere’s condition was brought to the attention of the police by one Apostle Samuel Sonaiki of the Celestial Church, Cele bus stop. Elkana said Sonaiki told the police at the Owode Onirin police station that he observed a girl of about 22 years old misbehaving on the Itowolo road. “A team of detectives led by the station’s Divisional Police Officer visited the uncompleted building and saw the girl. She was taken to Neolife hospital at Olakunle Street, Thomas bus stop, Owode Onirin, for medical attention. She was eventually moved to Akure for continuation of her psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation,” he added.
