In its effort at ensuring a polio-free country, Rotary International, in collaboration with the Nigeria National Polio Plus Committee, has donated a water facility to Kasaki Jeje, Karshi, Abuja, a site adopted by Rotary Club of Abuja Metro. The President of Rotary Club of Abuja Metro, Omotunde Balogun, said the initiative was part of the focus of the club to enhance sanitation and hygiene in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Balogun said, “This water is so important now with COVID-19 pandemic. We need water to wash our hands continuously. We need to keep the best hygiene possible. This borehole could not have come at a better time. “The people of Kasaki Jeje no longer need to walk long distances to fetch water. This will make it easier for them to keep all tenets of good hygiene.” The President of Nigeria National Polio Plus Committee, Kola Kazeem, said the facility was provided in order to complement government’s effort in less privileged communities. Kazeem, therefore, enjoined the community to ensure proper maintenance of the facility. The Village Head of Kasaki Jeje, Alhaji Tanko Gorobe, commended the gesture, noting that Rotary had done a lot for the community.
