I am running for president of the United States 🇺🇸! #2020VISION — ye (@kanyewest) July 5, 2020  In reaction to his declaration to contest and challenge Republican candidate, Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, many Twitter users have taken to Twitter to voice their opinions. While many viewed his ambition as way to pave way for Trump as he would sweep some presume votes from Biden, others have thrown their weight behind his bid. Daily Trust have some of the reactions, thus: Thank you for taking votes away from Biden and helping the @realDonaldTrump get re-elected! #Trump2020Landslide — Kaya Jones (@KayaJones) July 5, 2020  You have my full support! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2020  He was already shaking hands with trump years ago, there is no way he's going to do better than himAnd Biden, eh, should have been Bernie, once again — Pandalk (@Pandanleluc) July 5, 2020  Do you guys think this is all a joke? That potentially pulling votes away from the only nominee who can defeat Donald Trump is cute or funny? This is the height of privilege, ultimately it won't hurt you, you're wealthy enough to survive 4 more years of Trump! Come the fuck on! — ERIC BALFOUR (@ERICBALFOUR) July 5, 2020  No doubt that Donald Trump will help finance and organize any effort to get Kanye West on the ballot in as many states as possible in order to split the African American vote. Another middle finger from Trump to the American people. As bad as any act of voter suppression. pic.twitter.com/BBcTEvmBCG — Russell Drew (@RussOnPolitics) July 5, 2020  Your music has taught me much about you… You have my wish and blessings brother. And being Black counts more Kanye. pic.twitter.com/jpHqmo9iFS — Cellular ❁ (@robzinterris) July 5, 2020  Kanye West is going to help Trump win the 2020 election because he doesn't care about Black Americans or any Americans for that matter.  He is going to take votes from Biden just because Trump's tax cuts on the wealthy help him become even wealthier.  Kanye is the new Jill Stein. — Mrs. Krassenstein (@HKrassenstein) July 5, 2020  Experts conclude Kanye West is the least qualified person to ever run for the United States presidency, in a signal that he will almost certainly win the election — 𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝙲𝚑𝚊𝚜𝚎𝚛 (@chaser) July 5, 2020  Americans especially African-Americans and all people of color open your eyes: Kanye West running for presidency is a ploy by @realDonaldTrump to split your vote and help him secure his 2nd term. A vote for @kanyewest is a vote for Trump. #VoteBiden2020 — #BLM Dan Amos Sule 🇰🇪🇳🇦🇹🇿 (@sule_dan) July 5, 2020
