A philanthropist, Otunba Adebayo Popoola, has settled the medical bill of a mother, Miss Jumoke Fadahunsi, who was delivered of twins at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH), Ado Ekiti. Fadahunsi, who had been discharged more than a week earlier but was not allowed to go home because of a debt of N37,000, went home smiling on Sunday, together with two other women, Mrs Omowunmi Ajayi and Mrs Oyeleye, whose bills of N150,000 each Otunba Popoola paid. Other beneficiaries included Aina Fasila, Sofiat Oyeleye, Modupe Martins, Ebun Oladele and Mrs Adijat Arowolo, whose pregnant daughter, Rukayat, was suffering from a kidney disease. Otunba Popoola, who paid over N1 million in medical bills at the hospital, said the gesture was his modest contribution in assisting the needy and bringing smiles to their faces. Popoola’s outfit, Emma POP, is currently collaborating with the government of Ekiti State to fumigate the state to contain the coronavirus. He had earlier supervised the fumigation exercise of some major roads, markets and other public infrastructure before he entered the hospital’s maternity ward and was greeted with the sight of the beleaguered women. Emma POP is also fumigating the hospital’s premises and wards.
