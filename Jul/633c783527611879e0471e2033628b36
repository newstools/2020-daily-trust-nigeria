Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, says Sen. Dayo Adeyeye and a presidential aide, Babafemi Ojudu, are not his enemies despite the attacks being launched against him by some leaders of the APC. This remark came as the Ekiti APC stakeholders passed a vote of confidence on the governor and party executives from the ward to the state level on account of their “performances and strict adherence to the party’s vision.” It would be recalled that former Minister of Works, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Sen. Babafemi Ojudu, former Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Adewale Omirin and 12 others, had last week accused Governor Fayemi of dictatorship and vindictiveness. But, speaking at an APC stakeholders’ meeting held on Saturday in Ado Ekiti, Fayemi was quoted to have said the disagreement with Adeyeye, Ojudu and others, was a family affair. A statement by APC State Publicity Secretary Hon. Ade Ajayi, yesterday, said Fayemi maintained that  “whatever disagreement we have in Ekiti APC is a family affair.  I’m not an enemy to anyone and neither is anyone an enemy to me.” Ekiti July 14: Who flies APC ticket?
