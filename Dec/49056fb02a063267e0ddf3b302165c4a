The Toyota GT 86, a 2+2 sports car was jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru, manufactured at Subaru’s Gunma assembly plant along with a badge engineered variant, marketed as the Subaru BRZ. It is one of the classic sports cars to be developed by the automakers providing not only luxury that any enthusiast would wish for but it will also provide value for money. Though the All-New 2021 Toyota 86 model was designed as a sports car, it comes with a coupe-styled body, powerful engine, and advanced tech. It was however found that not much has been changed or added for the 2021 model. The 2021 model, which is expected to hit the local market this month is available in Hakone Edition trim, which blazes in green paint and bronze-coloured wheels. The standard features have also been unchanged since the previous 2020 Toyota 86. The only change that sets it apart is the slight power bump from 200 horses to 217 horsepower (HP) from the similar 2.0L NA engine. The seats are trimmed in soft-touch suede material which makes occupants comfortable at all times and is set to be carried forward for the year 2021 as well. Engine and performance updates The new Toyota 86 has earned its name by delivering top-notch performance at a budget price tag. The Coupe is more practical with design optimisations, exclusive material selection, and high-performance powertrain. The powertrain of the 2021 Toyota 86 includes a 2.0-litre naturally-aspirated Flat four-cylinder engine clubbed with a six-speed manual transmission that can manage to churn about 205HP and 156 pounds per feet of torque. Sprint capacity The new 2021 Toyota 86 can sprint from 0-60 mile power hour (MPH) in 6.4 seconds, thus making it one of the fastest automobiles in its segment. Also, the car’s top speed of 130MPH makes an astounding high-speed performance. Considering that there are no major changes made, the 2021 Toyota 86 is estimated to retain a similar fuel efficiency as before, with 25 Miles Per Gallon (MPG) in the city and 32MPG on the highway. It has a 13.2-gallon fuel tank which can traverse a distance of at least 315 miles in the Toyota 86.
