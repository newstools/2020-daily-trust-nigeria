Before the budget was passed, some senators had dismissed the committee report as lacking details and opposed the budget passage. They said despite getting 7% of its revenue as operational cost, the Customs still collected money from the federation account. Senate President Ahmad Lawan warned that the Senate would take punitive measures against agencies of government that were not up to date with their audited accounts. Lawan said it was a “sad commentary” that MDAs had not been submitting their audited accounts to the National Assembly, describing the act as unacceptable.
