The Patriotic Students and Stakeholders Forum (PSSF) has distanced itself from a proposed protest against the nation’s Service Chiefs. PSSF made the disclosure at a press conference on Wednesday where it alleged that plans were already on ground by those it termed disgruntled politicians to storm the streets of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and Lagos on Thursday to demand the sack of service chiefs. In a statement signed by convener, Comrade Tunde Badmus, PSSF disclosed that despicable elements benefiting from the Boko Haram crisis before the advent of the present administration want to ensure that the gains made so far are reversed. “These groups of individuals have elected to carry out acts against the interest of Nigeria by the aggressive and continuous push for the sack of Service Chiefs that have been outstanding in the discharge of their duties that has led to the recording of multiple gains in the fight against terrorism,” the group noted The group, consequently, called on the Police to ensure that it reinforces its officers and men to be able to quell any act of criminality by the protesters.
