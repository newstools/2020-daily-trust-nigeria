Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc has reported a $106.6 million (N40.5 billion) loss in its unaudited Q1: 2020 result released to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Despite the loss, the company’s board and management hinted of plans to invest US$120 million of capital expenditure in the current year, including two new gas wells and associated infrastructure. The loss was mainly driven by a $145.5 million (n55.3 billion) impairment loss (vs. gain of $.14.0 million in Q1’19) charged on its oil and gas assets during the period. General and administrative expenses increased by a staggering 56.5per cent in the period, with significant pressures from one-off director-retirement payments and general expenses. The company recorded an impairment charge of $145.5 million (vs. gain of $.14.0 million in Q1’19) on its oil & gas properties as a result of re-assessments of expected future cash flows from these assets due to significant fall in crude oil prices. Mr. Austin Avuru, the company’s Chief Executive Officerin his reaction said: “The business is hedged against low oil prices and a significant proportion of our revenues now come from gas, which offers further protection from oil price volatility. The Company has low production costs and can remain profitable even at lower oil prices. “We have significant cash resources available and will continue to manage our finances prudently in 2020, expecting now to invest US$120 million of capital expenditure across the year, including two new gas wells and associated infrastructure.” Seplat records loss before tax of N3.1bn in Q2 2017 2016: Naira devaluation takes toll on coys  half year  results Oil earnings hit $13.5bn in Q1 as exports to in July
