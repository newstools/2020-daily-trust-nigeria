A five-year old girl survived after she was run over by a Toyota Coaster bus when the driver of the bus swerved in order to avoid collision with another vehicle in Abuja yesterday. Some residents attempted to beat the woman who was driving a Mercedes Benz car for allegedly causing the accident. Witnesses said the baby and her mother were about boarding a taxi at the Apostolic Faith Junction after Jabi Upstairs on the Obafemi Awolowo Way when the bus ran over her. A witness, Musa, said, “The Coaster was coming from Airport Junction and the Benz was coming from Jabi Village. The driver of the Benz entered the road probably not seeing the Coaster coming from her left. The driver of the Coaster turned, trying not to hit the Benz, but eventually did. He then hit a Mazda parked by the road, climbed the green area before it was stopped by a pole.” He said the baby was pulled out from under the bus unhurt, but that an officer of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) chartered a taxi to take her to the Life Camp General Hospital.”  School bus hits fruit seller, plunges into gutter at Kubwa Teenage female hawker nearly crushed to death at Kubwa Passenger dies as bus rams into truck in Abaji
