Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday cancelled a weekend curfew introduced to halt the spread of coronavirus, pointing to concerns over the economy. Turkey has been locked down on weekends and public holidays since April, and the interior ministry said in the early hours of Friday that 15 cities would again be shuttered this weekend. However, hours later Erdogan announced on Twitter that he had cancelled the curfew after “feedback from our citizens” suggested it would have a negative economic impact. Cafes, restaurants and other public spaces reopened this week, sparking hopes that the curfew would be lifted.
