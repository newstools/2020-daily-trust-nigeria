The National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, was absent at the “special consultation” meeting President Muhammadu Buhari held with the security chiefs. The meeting, held behind closed doors, was attended by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Gabriel Olonisakin; the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. – Gen Tukur Buratai; the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshall Sadique Abubakar; and the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas. The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, also attended the meeting on the current security situation in the country. Daily Trust learnt that Monguno did not attend the meeting because he had travelled out of the country to represent President Buhari at Munich Security Summit. The NSA, who returned yesterday had in a leaked memo, reportedly alleged that undue interference by the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, on matters of national security, had slowed down meaningful gains that Buhari had sought to achieve. In the leaked memo to the service chiefs, which was published by an online platform, Premium Times, Monguno directed them (service chiefs) to desist from taking further directives from Kyari. Monguno had also alleged in the memo that Kyari’s directives to service chiefs were sometimes issued without the knowledge or approval of the president; a practice, he further alleged, had added to the government’s failure to contain insecurity. After yesterday’s consultation meeting, the service chiefs passed through the Office of the Chief of Staff to the President on their way out, while the Chief of Army Staff was the last person sighted leaving at about 3.55 pm. There had been several calls for the sack of service chiefs because of the frightening security situation in the country.
