The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has urged the police to sustain efforts aimed at uprooting criminal hideouts in the country following the successful raid at Kuduru forest in Kaduna state where about 250 criminals were killed. MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, who made the commendation in a statement, said that the criminals had been making life unbearable for residents of the area. “We commend the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) for storming Kuduru forest in Birnin Gwari, Kaduna state, a notorious headquarters of kidnappers and other criminals who have been making life unbearable for innocent citizens. “About 250 criminals were killed in the attack while one policeman died during the raid and another in the hospital. “Now that they have been given a taste of their own pudding, they must realise that crime does not pay. We are proud and fully endorse this police action,” he said. The director recalled that MURIC advised Nigerian security agencies some time ago to invade criminals’ den wherever they might be. “How can hoodlums create republics of their own within a republic? The only solution to that is to always storm their hideouts, and make it difficult for them to reassemble. “We also commiserate with families of the policeman who died during the raid and the one who died during treatment. “They are in our prayers. But most importantly, we remind their families that these men died as heroes and patriots. They must be proud of them. “It is always better to go down as great men than as cowards and criminals,” he said. MURIC appealed to Nigerians to repose more confidence in the ability of the police and other security agencies to protect the citizenry.
