Officials of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Seme Area Command, disclosed that they have intercepted two buses belonging to a big transport company over alleged movement of illicit drugs into the country. The buses, which were en route Lagos from Ghana, were intercepted during “an inward clearance” of passengers on board the bus. It was alleged that when the buses were searched, cartons of illicit drugs careful concealed under luggage were recovered. The Acting Customs Area Controller of the Command, Dalha Cheidi Wada, told journalists yesterday that officers of the command discovered that the buses were carrying a commercial quantity of amphetamine syrup.
