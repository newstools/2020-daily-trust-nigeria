The Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has ordered that all markets in the state that do not sell essential commodities like foodstuffs, medicines, medical equipment and water be closed down with effect from today. Fayemi explained the decision is being taken to curtail the spread of the dreaded coronavirus disease in the state by ensuring that citizens observe the social distancing practice, among other measures. The governorâ€™s directive was contained in a statement signed and released yesterday in Ado-Ekiti by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Yinka Oyebode. The statement quoted Fayemi as directing all medicine stores that would be open to the public to ensure they do not sell or display any other items whatsoever, while those selling foodstuffs should not display or sell anything else. The governor also appealed to commercial drivers and the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers and Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria in the state to reduce the outrageous fares they have been charging commuters, especially students who are returning home in large numbers, following the closure of schools in the state. Pharmacy stores were also urged not to hike the prices of essential drugs. Fayemi also reminded members of the public of the ban on gatherings of more than 20 persons, either for social, communal or religious purposes, saying a monitoring and enforcement taskforce has been dispatched across the state to enforce the directive. The governor urged all citizens in the state to join hands with the government and its agencies in the collective war against the coronavirus scourge.
