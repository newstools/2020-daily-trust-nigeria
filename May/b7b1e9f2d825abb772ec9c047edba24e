Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has no preferred candidate for the Plateau South Senatorial by-election, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state has said. The party, through its state secretary, Alhaji Musan Sati, stated this yesterday in an interview with our correspondent in Jos, on insinuations in some quarters that the governor had a preferred candidate in the upcoming senatorial by-election in the state. The by-election, which has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, is to fill the vacant position of late Ignatius Longjan, who died early this year. “It hasn’t been the attitude of Governor Simon Lalong to be pointing at whom to be elected in an election. He often allows candidates of the party to try their luck and whoever emerges as winner in a contest, would be accommodated because he believes that all party members are his children,” he said.
