The Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria says for businesses to survive in the post COVID-19 era, there is the need for readjustment of business models. The president and chairman of the governing council of the institute, Wale Adediran, said this at the 51st Annual General Meeting of the institute held virtually for the first time in the life of the institute due to COVID-19 protocol. He said the institute had envisaged a disruption in the world of work occasioned by the digital revolution, but the COVID-19 pandemic had fast-tracked the new normal. He recalled that the 2019 National Conference of the institute was themed ‘Disruption – Change the Game’ in anticipation of the changes in the world of work. He said: “no one expected this speed and this nature of disruption. “COVID-19 pandemic has brought us into that future we thought was still a few years away. We are now facing the new normal and the new world of work. “This has necessitated an immediate re-adjustment of business models, to enable organisations and individuals continue to survive while the disruption lasts and, thrive after it is all over.”
