The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has  inspected a five story building that can serve as an isolation and treatment facility for COVID 19 patients at Idu. A statement by the minister’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, said the building which is a new training facility can be modified to suit the purposes of treatment and isolation as required by the health authorities. “The most critical thing is that this place has a lot of space. We are talking of five floors. I don’t think the whole of Abuja will have a hospital facility that can accommodate up to five floors. More importantly, there is power here constantly, and there is adequate water supply,” the minister said. “I leave it now for the officials of the Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and of course our public health officials. Jointly, they will decide what needs to be done here and we have a lot of commitment from private organizations who are willing to support the national efforts to fight this disease. Once they all agree, I’m sure that within a very short period of time, this place can be made functional,” Bello added.
