A bill for the establishment of an agency for the de-radicalization and integration of repentant Boko Haram insurgents was read for the first time on the floor of the Senate on Thursday. The bill titled: “National Agency for the Education, Rehabilitation, De-radicalization and Integration of repentant insurgents in Nigeria (Est, etc) Bill, 2020”  was sponsored by former Yobe Governor, Senator Ibrahim Geidam, (Yobe East). The rise of Boko Haram in 2009 has claimed at least 27,000 lives. The insurgency has displaced nearly 2.4 million people in the Lake Chad Basin. To date, the Lake Chad Basin region is grappling with a complex humanitarian emergency. Over 3.3 million people have been displaced, including over 2.5 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in north-eastern Nigeria, over 550,000 IDPs in Cameroon, Chad and Niger and 240,000 refugees in the four countries, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
