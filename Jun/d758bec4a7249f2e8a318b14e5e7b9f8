One of the princes aspiring to the vacant throne of Iyin-Ekiti, in Irepodun/Ifelodun local government, Ekiti State, Prince Adeniyi Ajakaiye, has called on his fellow princes to unite and shun the intervention of “politicians, sycophants and those with selfish interest” in picking a new traditional ruler for the town and tackling the common problems facing it. Prince Ajakaiye, in a chat yesterday with newsmen at his country home in Iyin-Ekiti, also urged all the stakeholders that would be involved in the selection process to be fair and just. The former Director of Administration, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, eulogized the late Oluyin of Iyin-Ekiti, Oba Justice Ademola Ajakaiye, who joined his ancestors in September 2019, describing him as “an adviser that people from various classes regularly ran to for his words of wisdom.” The prince said, “It will be in the best interest of the town to sustain the developmental drive of the late Oba Ajakaiye through careful selection of the next occupant of the exalted stool of Oluyin of Iyin.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
