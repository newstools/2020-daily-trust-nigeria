US Vice President Mike Pence, whose press secretary tested positive for coronavirus, has decided to “keep his distance” from President Donald Trump for a few days, the White House said Tuesday. Katie Miller, Pence’s press secretary, tested positive for the virus last week along with a personal valet to Trump. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, “has made the choice to keep his distance for a few days” from the president. “I would just note that that’s his personal decision to make that,” McEnany said. “As to how many days he does that, that’s a decision for the vice president.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
