The Fulani community in Okpanam town, Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State has appealed to security agencies to properly investigate the burning of their settlement and bring the perpetrators to justice. The leader of Fulani residents in the area, Abubakar Haruna, said youths from the community invaded their camp and destroyed property on the presumption that they were responsible for the killing of some vigilante members. While appealing to the government to provide them security, Haruna said they were law abiding citizens who would never contemplate taking the law into their hands no matter the level of provocation. The counsel to the Fulani residents, Mohammed Elunor, described the mob action as unfortunate, saying a petition had already been forwarded to the police to investigate the matter.
