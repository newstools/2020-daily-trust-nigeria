The Ekiti State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Mr Solomon T. Iyamu, has cautioned drivers and commuters to stop violating the no-movement order by the state government as it battles to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Iyamu stated this while addressing some erring drivers, motorcycle riders and commuters in his office in Ado Ekiti yesterday. According to the NSCDC boss, the stay-at-home order was meant to protect the drivers and others, as well as the next generation of Nigerians and any attempt to flagrantly violate it may result in serious crisis for the nation as is happening in Europe and United States. He called on them to respect the order, saying the state government had provisions for free days in the new two weeks stay-at-home order where people can stock their homes with essential items. Iyamu also called on officers and men of the Ekiti State to stand firm during this trying period as the people of the state were looking up on them. In a release sent to newsmen in Ado-Ekiti by the Corp’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Tolu Afolabi, said the order by the state government was meant to be enforced by all security agencies in the state, and as such the Corps had deployed over 1,200 officers and men to all the nooks and crannies of the state to work with other security agencies to enforce the order. According to him, the Disaster Management Unit of the Corps was also moving round the state to sensitize the people on the benefit of hand-washing and mask usage during this trying period, as he said the unit was also into rescue exercise in case of emergency, especially rescuing the vulnerable ones in need of first aid and other paramedical services.
