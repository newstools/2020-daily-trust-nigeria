Senator Abdullahi Adamu (APC, Nasarawa) yesterday cautioned Nigerians against politicising the current security challenges in the country. Adamu, a two-term former governor of Nasarawa State, said: “We must desist from politicising our security challenges. It is important to highlight the fact that this is about saving our country.” Senator Adamu who is also the Turakin Keffi, in a statement in Abuja, called on Nigerians to support the Federal Government in the fight against insecurity. He said  the call became necessary, considering the heightening agitations about the security situation in the country. He said: “The current security challenges are such that all patriots must rally round the Federal Government and our men in uniform whose lives are placed on harm’s way in the course of performing their duties to the nation. We’re duty-bound to appreciate them. “I appreciate the fact that the fundamental duty of every government is to protect lives and property of its citizenry, but in moments like this, every citizen has an inherent duty and responsibility to stand up with government to overcome the type of security challenges our country faces today. “Our security should be every citizen’s concern. The need for all hands to be on deck does not have to be overemphasized.” Adamu added: “We all have a duty to put Nigeria first. In fact, Nigeria and Nigerians had in the past overcome greater challenges. We can, together, do it again.”  Focus on North East heightened insecurity in other parts – Buhari Insecurity: Lawan, Adamu kick as Abaribe asks Buhari to resign Insecurity: Senator asks Buhari to resign, says "Nigerians won't hesitate to stone APC leaders"
