The Osun State government has assured the people of the state that the on-going water project in Ilesa axis will be completed soon to ensure provision of potable water. The Osun State Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy, Dr Amidu Tadese Raheem, disclosed this yesterday in Osogbo during the commemoration of the 2020 World Water Day, which had the theme, ‘Water and Climate Change.’ The Special Adviser to the Governor on Water Resources and Energy, Engineer Adeniran Felix Ibitoye, said the event would be used to sensitise the residents on the significance of water to healthy living and the need for them to maintain personal hygiene. Tadese said, “As countries across the globe mark the 2020 World Water Day, the state government of Osun is committed to providing potable water supply across the nooks and crannies of the state.” Raheem, who described water as indispensable to healthy living, said the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola had strengthened the capacity of the ministry towards the provision of potable water for the citizens. Ibitoye, lauding the efforts of the government at ensuring drinking water for the people of the state, noted that the state had remained relentless in its efforts at increasing access to potable water through rehabilitation of existing water mains and facilities in the urban, semi-urban and rural communities of the state. He said “The Osun Water Corporation has been saddled with overseeing the day-to-day functioning and maintenance of these schemes. In this connection, Gov Oyetola recently approved the establishment of the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (STOWA) and the State Water Regulatory Commission (WRC).
