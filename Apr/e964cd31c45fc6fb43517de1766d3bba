The Enugu State Commissioner for Health, Professor Anthony Ugochukwu, died on Friday night at Memphys Hospital, Enugu. The House of Assembly member representing his constituency, Oji River (State) Constituency, Jeff Mbah, who confirmed news of his death yesterday,  described his passage as a great loss to Enugu State and Nigeria. “We are talking about a renowned surgeon who had a lot to offer in turning around our health sector, it’s a terrible blow,” he said. Mbah said the late commissioner had just returned from the United States and was fine before suddenly falling ill. He had taken ill when he was  the Provost, College of Medicine, but later recovered and concluded his work in the college. But shortly after he was appointed commissioner last year, the illness returned. As a result, he was inconsistent on duty before his death, as most of his official functions were carried out by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Dr Ifeanyi Agujiobi.
