The Ekiti State Chief Judge, Justice Ayodeji Daramola, has set free 44 awaiting trial inmates in Ekiti State, while three others were granted bail in liberal terms. Justice Daramola advised those who just regained their freedom to obey the law, and also advised lawyers to be mindful of politically motivated cases to avoid denting their images. Those freed included 43 males and one female awaiting trial inmates at the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS), along Afao road, in the state capital. Addressing newsmen after the exercise, Justice Daramola said 420 cases, involving 413 males and seven females, were reviewed and inmates charged with lesser offences ranging from stealing to burglary were released. The Chief Judge, who was conducted round the facilities by the Comptroller of Correctional Services, Mr Afolabi Akinyemi, commended officials of the NCS for ‘‘taking good care of the inmates’’, as well as keeping a clean and healthy environment. One of the freed inmates, Ilori Akinola, on behalf of his mates, thanked Justice Daramola for the gesture and assured him that they would no longer be engaged in any unlawful act that would bring them to prison. In a chat with newsmen, Mr Akinyemi, said the exercise would decongest the service and “give room for its optimal performance.”  Ekiti CJ pardons 44 inmates Ekiti chief judge releases 28 awaiting trial inmates Nigeria’s prisons remain same despite name change
