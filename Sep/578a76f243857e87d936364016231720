Some leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State have condemned a series of advocacy for zoning. The party leaders said the advocacy for zoning ahead of Bayelsa West Senatorial By-election was a ploy to deny the people of Ekeremor LGA fair representation in the political affairs of the state. They added that it was also a “deliberate attempt” to foist the immediate past governor of the State, Seriake Dickson, on the people thereby concentrating major political offices – governor, deputy governor and senator – in one LGA to deny others the opportunity to be represented. The leaders, under the auspices of Bayelsa West APC Leadership Forum, made their position known in a communique issued at the weekend in Sagbama Town signed by the chairman of the group, Nestor Binabo and secretary, Gad Ombeh.
