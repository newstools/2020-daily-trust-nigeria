Members of Federal Government’s Economic Advisory Council have gone into self-isolation having recently met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. A member of the council, Professor Ode Ojuwu, confirmed to Daily Trust yesterday that he was in self-isolation. On March 17, 2020, the council met with Buhari and briefed him on economic matters. The Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, who had tested positive to COVID-19, was present at the meeting. “I can only confirm for myself. I am not sure everyone of us had direct contact with the CoS on Tuesday 17 March. I had a personal contact with him after the meeting. I sincerely wish him speedy recovery to continue his service to Nigeria,” Ojowu said. Daily Trust learnt that other members of the council may have been exposed to COVID-19 during the meeting. Members and their spouses are said to be in the self-imposed isolation. President Buhari set up the council in September, 2019 to advise him on economic policy matters, including fiscal analysis, economic growth and a range of internal and global economic issues, working with the relevant cabinet members and heads of monetary and fiscal agencies. The council, chaired by Prof. Doyin Salami, a former member of the monetary policy committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and senior lecturer at the Lagos Business School, has Ode Ojowu, Shehu Yahaya, Iyabo Masha, Chukwuma Soludo, Bismark Rewane, and Mohammed Adaya Salisu as members.
