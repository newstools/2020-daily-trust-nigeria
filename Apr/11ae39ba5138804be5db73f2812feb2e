The Nigerian Legion Corps of Commissionaires has mobilised over 100 officers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to monitor compliance with the lockdown order. Speaking with newsmen in Abuja recently, Okon Mkpafit, Deputy Corps Commandant of the legion, said immediately after the maiden announcement of the lockdown order by President Muhammadu Buhari, the corps launched street-to-street monitoring of compliance within the city centre and in the satellite towns. “In collaboration with other security organisations, the Nigeria Legion has placed its men and officers at strategic beats to enforce the lockdown order. “Last two weeks, we distributed hand sanitisers, face masks and leaflets among others to residents and also enlightened them on the instructions they should follow so that they will be free from the clutches of the coronavirus. This is an exercise we have sustained,” he said. He further stated that the organisation is poised to carry out fumigation of public places, especially worship centres, schools, markets, gardens, hotels and other relaxation points if resources are put at their disposal. Okon called on other security organisations as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to move fast and contribute their quota to help contain the novel virus, saying, the emergency requires collaborative efforts. The Nigerian Legion Corps of Commissionaires was established by the Nigerian Legion Act No.37 in1988 as an association of all retired military officers called the veterans (President Muhammadu Buhari is also a member), as a voluntary organisation saddled with the responsibility of providing security to both public and private entities.
