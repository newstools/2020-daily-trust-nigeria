The Lagos State Government said it is planning to set up an e-commerce hub for agriculture producers to sell farm produce to create export opportunities. The Acting Commissioner for Agriculture, Ms. Abisola Olusanya disclosed this at the inspection tour of venues for the Eko City Farmers Market (Ileya edition), which commenced on Sunday at St. Georges Primary School, Falomo; Opebi Primary School; Ikeja primary school and 23 other venues. According to her, the hub will be centrally located to allow certification of farm produce to take place in a single location. “We are trying to setup hubs where we are able to get our producers come together to produce under a sanitary and hygienic condition, so that we can get organisations like Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFDAC) to do the necessary assessment on the items being processed for export. “We want to essentially make it easier for our producers to sell their produce in a way that they do not have to go through many channels to certify their products. We want to ensure that the certification takes place in one location so that they can easily be exported.” she noted. The commissioner further disclosed the plan by the state government to organise a virtual stakeholders’ engagement in August as part of efforts to determine the inherent challenges in the agricultural space with a view to proffering solutions to mitigate them.
