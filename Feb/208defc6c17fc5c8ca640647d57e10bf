The Edo State government has alleged that the faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) loyal to National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, is orchestrating violence for the declaration of emergency rule in the state. The Commissioner of Information and Orientation, Mr. Paul Ohonbamu, said this in reaction to Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, asking Governor Godwin Obaseki to visit the residences of the party chieftains who were recently attacked with explosives by suspected arsonists in Benin. “All these orchestrated attacks and bombs are targeted at the governor. First, it was the House of Assembly. We now have legislative IDPs who, rather than accept that they are at fault to go back to the house for inauguration, they are enjoying their servitude. “Their plan is to cause violence in the state so as to pave way for President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency in the state and the plot will fail,” he said. He said their plan was to remove Governor Godwin Obaseki from office but they resorted to violence when they couldn’t achieve that through the house of assembly. Responding on behalf of Oshiomhole’s faction, a former Attorney General and Commissioner of justice, Henry Idiagbon, said the allegation was not correct. “That is not correct, they are the one creating the tension and the security challenges in the state. They want to kill all those who are not supporting them and we are begging God to intervene before they killed all us,” he said.
