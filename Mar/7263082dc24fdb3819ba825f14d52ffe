Action Democratic Party (ADP) has said the defection of its governorship candidate for Lagos State in 2019, Babatunde Gbadamosi, to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cannot in any way affect the fortunes of the party. National Publicity Secretary of the party, Prince Adelaja Adeoye, said the party has been in existence before Gbadamosi came to join. It would be recalled that Gbadamosi, who contested the 2019 governorship on the ADP’s platform, returned to the PDP on Monday. In a statement, the ADP spokesman said the party remained a formidable one across the country. He said, “As we all know, politics is a game of interest; it is a free join and free exit. No person or individual can be conditioned to stay in a party against their wishes, therefore, his exit does not and cannot tamper with the formidable structure of our great party in Lagos State.” “We can assure Lagosians that our party, ADP, will present a more popular candidate in Lagos for the 2023 governorship and will win.” Ex-ADP Lagos gov’ship candidate returns to PDP How Lagos guber candidates are shaping up for  battle It’s obvious Osun people voted massively for Adeleke- ADP guber candidate
