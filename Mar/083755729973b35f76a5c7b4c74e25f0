Kaduna State House of Assembly has approved death benefits for any serving governor, deputy governor and family in the event of death while in office in the state. The family of a governor or his deputy will receive a gross annual salary of the incumbent governor or deputy governor as death benefit. This followed the passage of a bill for a law to amend the Pension and Gratuity (Governor and Deputy Governor) Law 2006. The law cited as the Pension and Gratuity (Governor and Deputy Governor) Law, 2020 is for making provision for death benefits in the event a governor or deputy governor died while in office. Addressing newsmen shortly after the passage of the bill, the chairman, Ad hoc committee, Suleiman Ibrahim Dabo, who is the member representing Zaria City constituency, said the key point of the bill was that the death benefit of the governor or his deputy respectively should be approved. “Looking at the critical role and responsibilities carried out by these two individuals,  it would be unfair to say that in the event of death which can happen to either of the two while in office, they will just go like that without anything,” he said. The plenary session was presided over by the Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Muktar Isa Hazo.
