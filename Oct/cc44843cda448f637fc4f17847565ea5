The Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) Candidate and Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi has not withdrawn from the race contrary to an online report, his spokesman, Babatunde Okeowo has said. “What you are reading is a fake document emanating from the government,” he said in a chat with Daily Trust. “What you are reading is not true. How can he withdraw his ambition? Somebody who is contesting to win, that’s not true. Those behind the fake news are not even intelligent about it.” The reaction comes in the wake of a circulating report hours before the election that he had withdrawn. Voting has already started in Ondo, as more than a million voters go to the polls to elect a governor.
