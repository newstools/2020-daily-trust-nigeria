A 33-year-old man, Ahmed Onikoyi, has been docked before an Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, magistrate court over alleged assault. The police prosecutor, Sergeant Olubu Apata, told the court yesterday that Onikoyi committed the offence on March 8, 2020 at about 5pm at a hotel in Ado-Ekiti. Apata alleged that the defendant assaulted and wounded one Agbana Bolarinwa, using a vehicle key to hit him in the mouth and head and inflicting on him a deep injury in the process. The prosecutor also alleged that the defendant damaged a Honda Accord EOD car valued at N950,000, property of the complainant. Apata said Bolarinwa had placed a ‘FOR SALE’ sign on his car and when Onikoyi came with a purported intention to buy it, he told the owner that he wanted to test the car so he could detect any fault. He added that when the defendant brought the car back to the complainant, it had been damaged and the complainant got angry with him. The prosecutor alleged that Onikoyi then assaulted Bolarinwa and wounded him with the vehicle’s key. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor asked the court for adjournment to enable him study the case file and present his witnesses. Onikoyi’s counsel, Mr Olawumi Olowolafe, urged the court to grant his client bail, with a promise he would not jump it. The magistrate, Mrs Kehinde Awosika, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200,000, with one surety in like sum, and adjourned the case till April 6, 2020 for hearing.
