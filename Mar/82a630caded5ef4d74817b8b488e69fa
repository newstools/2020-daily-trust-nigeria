Helicopter services company, Caverton and Thales of France, has signed the Factory Acceptance of the AW139 Reality HFull-Flight Simulator, the first helicopter full flight simulator Level ‘D’ tobe installed in Africa. This is coming barely one year after both companies signed contract for AW139 pilot training at Caverton Aviation Training Center in Nigeria. The Thales Reality H Full Flight Simulator level ‘D’, is one of the world’s most advanced commercial helicopter simulators which will be used to provide superior scenario-based flight and mission training to AW139 helicopter operators across the African continent as well as Caverton’s pilots and crew. With this simulator, Caverton will deliverstate-of-the-art training: including Initial Type Rating, Recurrent Training and Proficiency Checks for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), offshore and onshore missions as well as VIP operationsto unprepared landing sites. This simulator will enable pilots to become certified to fly the AW139 under various Civil Aviation Authority approvals. Pilots can thus train safely in high-riskmission scenarios in a range of adverse weather conditions. Speaking on the agreement signed in France, MD Caverton Helicopters Ltd, Rotimi Makanjuola, described the agreement as “animportant milestone” not just for Caverton as an indigenous company, but for Nigeria and the African continent. “We pride ourselves in being pioneers insafety innovation and are committed to providing enhanced training opportunities for our pilots in-country as well as to third party operators across Africa. With this significant investment and with the support from Thales, a globally renowned company, we believe that the simulator will ultimately benefit our customers and increase accessibility to world class flight simulation training services,” he said.  ‘Caverton adopts Thales technology for pilots’ training’ Row in NCAT over alleged diversion of equipment We are locating NCAT’s simulator in Lagos for commercial gains – Rector
