Operatives of the Ogun State Police Command said they have arrested four suspected armed robbers who have been on their wanted list. The police described the suspects – Sukanmi Tajudeen, Habeeb Oladimeji, Sunday Akintunde and Ishola Samson – as members of a notorious syndicate that had allegedly been terrorising the Mowe/Ofada areas in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government of the state. A statement issued yesterday by the Command’s spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the suspects were arrested following an intelligence report that men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) received about the hideout of the gang at Adesan, Mowe.  “On getting the report, the officer-in-charge of SARS, Chief Superintendent Tijani Muhammed, dispatched his operatives to the area and the hideout was professionally cordoned off for an operation, which lasted for about an hour. “At the end of the operation, the four suspects were apprehended, while some members of the gang escaped through the nearby bush,” Oyeyemi said. According to him, items recovered from the suspects included one locally made triple barrel pistol, one locally made single barrel pistol, 13 live cartridges and one motorcycle. He said the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, who praised the gallantry his men displayed, had ordered a manhunt for the fleeing members of the gang.
