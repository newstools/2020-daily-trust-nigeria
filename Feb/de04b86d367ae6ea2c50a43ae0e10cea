A hamlet of about 43 huts has been razed down by fire allegedly set by a farmer near Sauka village, on the Airport Road, Abuja, Federal Capital Territory. City News learnt that a farmer identified just as Muhammed, who is a native of the area, was arrested and detained over the incident by the Iddo Police Division. Our reporter, who visited the hamlet, which is known as Rugan Wakili Jagere, on Tuesday, saw women and children sitting in an open field close to their burnt huts, where they said they have passed their first night, following the incident, which took place around 10 am on Monday. Ibrahim Wakili, one of the persons who lost his home to the fire, alleged that the suspect set fire on a farmland, which is close to the herders’ hamlet, but it got out of control and gutted the entire hamlet. Another elder in the community, Malam Musa Muhammed, said a similar experience happened in the hamlet two years ago, where some youths allegedly set it ablaze. Leader of the Fulani community in the area, Malam Umar Isiaka, has expressed gratitude to Allah for sparing the lives of vulnerable ones, elderly persons and little children, who he said, were around when the incident happened. “We lost everything we have to this disaster and we therefore called on the FCT Administration and humanitarian agencies to assist us,” Isiaka said. When contacted, the Divisional Police Officer of Iddo, CSP Tunde Kabiru, confirmed the incident, adding that the accused person was arrested just as investigation is ongoing.
