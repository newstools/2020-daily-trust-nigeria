The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has urged residents to take responsibility for their personal safety, saying no musical concert is worth anybody’s life. The minister who was reacting to Naira Marley’s concert held at the Jabi Lake Mall last Saturday and which attracted hundreds of spectators in clear violation of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 and FCTA guidelines on curbing the spread of the virus, also vowed to prosecute the organisers and the performers. In a statement, the minister’s spokesman, Anthony Ogunleye, said, “Videos of the event which are still circulating on social media clearly show a concert going on with music and live performances by a band and dancers. The videos also show attendees dancing to the live performances on the elaborately constructed stage.” Ogunleye added that several aspects of the guidelines as postulated by the PTF on COVID-19, as well as the FCTA, were violated, stressing that the actions of the organisers and attendees at the concert were reckless, wicked, insensitive and demonstrated utter disrespect and disregard for the law and the wellbeing and welfare of fellow citizens. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. Through Ogunleye, the minister also said the FCTA which had responsibility to protect the lives of the citizenry was determined to prosecute all those involved in orchestrating the infractions to the full extent of the law.
