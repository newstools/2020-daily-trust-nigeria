Senator  Abiodun Olujimi has advised PDP members in Ekiti State  to elect  State Working Committee (SWC)  members that will unify the party at the coming Congress to be able to wrest power from the APC ahead of the 2022 governorship poll. Olujimi, who is representing Ekiti South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, said the  best way for the PDP to become stronger in Ekiti ahead of the election is by adopting collegiate leadership to fortify the party and bring a sense of belonging to every member. She added that it will be great disservice to the party’s teeming members yearning for good, focused and committed leadership for anybody to contemplate what she called “imposed leadership” at this time against the wishes of loyal party members . It will be recalled that Olujimi and former Governor Ayodele Fayose had been battling for the soul of the PDP leadership in Ekiti, a development that created division within the party. In her statement to PDP members in Ado Ekiti yesterday, Sen. Olujimi said: “as the Congress draws near, we must work together to install a strong, passionate, honest, vibrant, fair , loyal and committed party man, who will unite and not divide us, as Chairman. “Our sole agenda will be Ekiti first, PDP next, any hidden agenda to perpetuate undemocratic and punitive tendencies in PDP will be resisted. “I urge that we all work together to restore the glory of our party because it is crystal clear that God will only install whom He pleases.” Speaking about her recent judicial victory which led to the removal of APC candidate, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, through litigation, Olujimi praised the  APC National leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu , the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan  and the Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi for standing on the side of truth and justice in the litigation.
