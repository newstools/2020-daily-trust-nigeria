Consequently, market capitalisation fell to N12.7tn as investors lost N9.8bn, while Year-To-Date (YTD) loss worsened to -9.5 per cent.

Performance across sectors was bearish as four of six indices closed negative week-on-week (w/w). The AFR-ICT and industrial goods indices were the gainers, up 3.9 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively following price appreciation in Airtel Africa (+5.9 per cent), CUTIX (+10.3 per cent) and BUA Cement (+1.2 per cent). On the flip side, the banking index led laggards, depreciating 3.9 per cent due to sell pressures in Unity Bank (-8.2 per cent), Zenith (-5.7 per cent) and GTB (-4.2 per cent). Likewise, sell-offs in Link Assurance (-14.9 per cent), Nigerian Breweries IES (-11.9 per cent) and Conoil (-10.6 per cent) dragged the insurance, consumer and oil and gas indices lower by 1.9 per cent apiece.
