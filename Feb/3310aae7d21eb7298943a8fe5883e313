A former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has asked the National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to seek a review of the Supreme Court verdict on the 2019 governorship election in the state which upheld the election of candidate of the APC, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. In a statement issued yesterday by Ibrahim Adam, the Media Aide to Abba Kabir Yusuf, the PDP governorship candidate in the election, quoted Kwankwaso as saying that there was need for the PDP to approach the apex court for a review of the judgement. According to the statement, Kwankwaso made the appeal when he paid a solidarity visit Wednesday, to the NWC at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja. The former governor lamented that “Kano people were robbed of their mandate through voter disenfranchisement and manipulation of judicial processes.” According to the statement, the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus who was represented by the Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif said PDP has taken Kano as its major support base and would do everything within the confines of the law to protect its interests in the state.
