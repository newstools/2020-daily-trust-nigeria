… Also to suspend operations to Dakar-Senegal and Monrovia-Liberia Nigeria’s leading carrier, Air Peace, has reduced its operations in response to the ravaging coronavirus pandemic. The airline said it took the decision after an emergency meeting with its top management staff to review its operations in the face of the disease, which the World Health Organisation (W.H.O) has already declared as a global pandemic. The management also announced several measures aimed at addressing the adverse effects occasioned by the disease. Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the airline,  Toyin Olajide, said the decision to cut down its flights followed “tremendous decline in passenger traffic and the need to cut costs.” While scaling down west coast operations, the airline said it would suspend its international operations into Dubai through Sharjah International airport from next week as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has shut its airports to nationals from other countries including but not limited to Nigeria. She said: “Air Peace, as a result of the adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on passenger traffic, has today taken the hard decision to downsize our flight operations in order to cut the mounting costs occasioned by the pandemic.” She added that the airline would be suspending its operations to Dakar-Senegal and Monrovia-Liberia and cutting down its Freetown-Sierra leone operations and Banjul-Gambia operations to one flight a week. She disclosed that the airline would also be reducing its operations into Accra from Lagos to just two flights daily and suspend its Abuja-Accra operations. “On the domestic scene, we are reducing our frequencies while at the same time, restructuring our operations by deploying our hoppers to more airports,” Olajide added.
