Two out of nine aspirants seeking the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to contest the October 10 governorship election have been screened out. The PDP primary poll will hold on July 22 and 23, where the party’s candidate would be elected by delegates ahead of the October election. Chairman of the screening committee and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara who briefed newsmen at the end of the exercise last night in Abuja, however, declined to mention the names of those disqualified. The aspirants who participated in the exercise are; the deputy governor of Ondo state, Hon. Agboola Ajayi, Barrister Eyitayo Jegede and Dr Eddy Olafeso, Barr. Sola Ebiseni, Senator Boluwaji Kunlere, Mr Banji Ben Okunomo, Otunba Bamidele Akingboye and Chief Bode Ayorinde. Dogara said the two aspirants screened out were at liberty to approach the Appeals Committee on Monday, to seek redress. “I’m not happy to report this to you, but about two failed the litmus test. That is not to say that they have been disqualified, because we don’t have the powers to disqualify anybody,” he said. Meanwhile, the PDP has appointed Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State to head its Campaign Council for the September 19 governorship election in Edo state. This was made known through the official twitter handle of the party @Officialpdpnig.
