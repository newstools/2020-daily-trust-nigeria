The Federal Government has raised alarm over possible “unnecessary deaths” because hospitals are turning back non-COVID-19 related patients. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and chairman, Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, said this at the 32nd joint national briefing of the taskforce in Abuja yesterday. He also said N792, 121,613.89 was donated by Nigerians as at May 14 with some Nigerians donating N1 (one naira). “We have noticed a marked reduction in the delivery of non-COVID-19 related services in our hospitals. You will recall that the Minister of Health had on several occasions implored our health institutions not to jeopardise offering critical health services to patients who require attention.

He said the PTF remained firmly supportive of the development of a cure for the disease, but must follow laid down protocols. He said the PTF had received media reports about an extrapolated level of prevalence of COVID-19 in Kano based on the number of some foreign nationals that had been evacuated from Nigeria. According to him, the PTF team of experts is in Kano working round the clock alongside the teams from the state based on scientific and statistical analysis.
