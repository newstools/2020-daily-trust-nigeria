The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has assured that they will soon resume supplies of kerosene, PMS and AGO to the NNPC Calabar port after 25 years. Operation Controller of DPR in the State, Philip Awolu, gave this assurance in his office when Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) called on him yesterday. Awolu said they are ready to cooperate with IPMAN so long as their activities do not go contrary to the laws governing sales and marketing of petroleum product. He however warned that DPR would not fail to deal decisively with any member of the association that errs, advising IPMAN to document whatever challenges which they are passing through and send to DPR office.
