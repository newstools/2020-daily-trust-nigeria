Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has advised the federal government to be wary of the involvement of France in the Eco currency project. Giving this advice in the Association’s Quarterly Review for the fourth quarter of 2019 (Q4’19), ABCON’s President,  Aminu Gwadabe, said  Nigeria should critically examine the role of France in the ECO currency project before eciding whether Nigeria should participate. He described the recent decision of the Francophone countries to change the name of their common currency to ECO as worrisome and should be seen as an attempt by France to continue its dominant control of the Francophone West Africa country’s economies. The ABCON boss warned: “Nigeria must not adopt the currency with France or Euro as the background promoters to avoid enslaving West Africa economically. “If the prime objective to facilitate cross border trade and economic development of the member states is still to be achieved, the structure of the system must be built on fundamentals in the sub region to compete with other economic blocks. “Government is encouraged to pursue the project with sincerity of purpose based on sound policies devoid of interference from any economic bloc. The central bank of the sub region should be independent to invest its reserves in any world currency to satisfy the interest of constituent states.” Meanwhile, ABCON has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to address the various factors threatening the profitability of BDC business in the country. “A market structure that exposes a BDC firm to unconventional structure, unfair competition and risk must be avoided,’’ he said. Stressing that the CBN should allow BDCs to determine what to buy and sell.
