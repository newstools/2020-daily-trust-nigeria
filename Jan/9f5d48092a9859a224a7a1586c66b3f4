The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Archdiocese, Most Rev Ignatius Kaigama, has called on Nigerians not to despair in 2020, saying that the year holds better prospect than last year. He made the admonition in Jos the Plateau state capital while felicitating with children from all denominations and different religions during his yearly beginning of the year celebration with the less privileged children. The Archbishop admonished that everyone should play his part so that the nation can emerge stronger and one of the best in the world. “Nigerians should not lose hope. Sometimes we tend to despair and say things are so hopeless, but we should not. This is 2020, and I keep telling people that even the name 2020 sound sweeter than the name 2019. So we should be optimistic and resilient and trust that everything will be alright.” He also called on parents to take good care of their children, saying they are gift from God, saying “We should handle children with tenderness and they should be groomed to grow like Jesus grew. That is in wisdom, in strength and in the fear of the Lord. So I have come all the way from Abuja to meet with the children and to celebrate with them as we do yearly.
