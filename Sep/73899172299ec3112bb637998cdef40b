The Special Adviser on Political Matters to the President, Senator Babafemi Ojudu and 10 others are to appear before a disciplinary committee constituted by the APC in Ekiti State for alleged insubordination and anti-party activities. The APC in the state had set up an eight-member disciplinary committee headed by former speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Sola Ajigbolamu, to invite Ojudu and others to answer questions on why they allegedly refused to withdraw the cases they instituted against the party as directed by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. In his reaction, Senator Ojudu, who described his invitation as “laughable”, said the action was against the constitution of the party “because the state working committee lacked the power to suspend any member”.
