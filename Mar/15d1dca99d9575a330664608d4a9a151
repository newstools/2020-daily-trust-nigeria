The Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission, Tony Ojukwu, has called on the Inspector-General of Police to fish out those behind the alleged shooting on the NHRC’s premises yesterday. Ojukwu, who addressed journalists at the commission’s headquarters yesterday, also asked the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to intervene. “Some shots were fired at the commission around noon. “As you can see, these are the bullet holes on the building and damaged cars “The police supposedly tear-gassed members of the banned Islamic Movement of Nigeria who were protesting on the Aguiyi Ironsi Street where the head office of the NHRC is located. “Other government agencies along the street may have felt the effect of the tear-gas but none reported live bullet shots into their compounds destroying official and personal property’’, he said. Ojukwu added: “The commission requests that there must be accountability for these attacks. “It is because the earlier attacks were not punished that this reoccurrence has happened.” FGGC Gboko alumni seek IGP’s help on alleged rapist Nightclub raids: NHRC hears rights groups over alleged harassment FG mandates NHRC to investigate complaints on SARS
