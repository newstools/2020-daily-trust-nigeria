In the face of the rising cases of COVID 19 pandemic in the country, a  Non-Government Organisation, PLAN Nigeria, says it is critical that containment and mitigation policies, systems and actions pay adequate attention to the concerns of the voiceless and vulnerable, especially women, adolescent girls, persons with preexisting conditions such as HIV,TB and disabled persons. In a policy brief by the NGO titled ‘COVID 19: The Need for an Inclusive Approach’ sourced by Daily Trust, the organization pointed out that the crisis will not only impact on the economy, but the lives of the poor and vulnerable people. It, therefore, charged the governments and other stakeholders involved in the ongoing efforts to contain further spread of the scourge to make the interventions get to the socio-economically disadvantaged people as a strategic option of mitigating the impact on all facets of national life. The NGO stated: “There has been increasing but understandable concern about the impact of the pandemic on Nigeria’s economy. The government is therefore instituting policies and mechanism to stimulate the economy and keep it afloat. “While these are important measures, they appear to be corporate focus to the exclusion of the informal sector, where a vast majority of the populace earn their livelihood, these include the poor, vulnerable and excluded citizens”, it added. According to the group, in stimulating the economy, the government will need to take an important note of the poor and vulnerable as the lock-down in cities and major informal market centres will further compound the conditions of these groups.
