The Deputy National Leader of the Izala Movement in Nigeria, Sheikh Yusuf Sambo Rigachikun, on Saturday narrated how he paid N10,000 fine for not wearing face mask in an outing in Kaduna. He said he was caught breaking the rule when he was in a vehicle with one of his children. The popular cleric, who is also the Kaduna State chairman of the Supreme Council for Sharia, was tried by a mobile court set up by the State government to enforce the use of face masks. He said it was not in his character to go out without a face mask, and on that day the mask was inside the vehicle.

Sheikh Rigachikun said it is the responsibility of religious leaders to encourage people to abide by the law, but added, however, that the mobile court needed to have followed due process by passing the law through the state House of Assembly, followed by a public debate on it before making it operational.
