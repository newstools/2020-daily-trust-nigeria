The FCT Administration has opened bids for 47 lots at the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) for cleaning, supply of vehicles and other materials like computers. City News reports that the opening bids for the AEPB jobs were advertised four and half weeks ago. Speaking on the sidelines of the exercise, Director FCT Procurement , Ibrahim Gusau, said the pre-qualification (technical bid) exercise is for a three-year contract for the advertised 47 lots. Gusau noted that the department in line with the Procurement Act  invited organisations  such as Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), ICPC, NGOs and the media, to witness the exercise. He said the first attempt to open the technical bidding last year, more than 450 companies bidded and it was cancelled because of complaints and petitions. He added that after the pre-qualification (technical bid) exercise, the companies that are credible  will be called for financial bid within the next three to four months.
