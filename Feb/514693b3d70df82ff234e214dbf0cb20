Farmers and herdsmen in Plateau State have pledged to live in peace with one another and do all they could to halt hostilities that have been costing lives and properties. The pledge from both parties came at the end of days of peace mediation workshop for Community Initiatives to Promote Peace (CIPP) funded by USAID through a consortium, led by Mercy Corps, including the African Radio Drama Association (ARDA), Interfaith Mediation Centre (IMC), Pastoral Resolve (PARE) and Savannah Center for Diplomacy Democracy & Development (SCDDD). One of the herdsmen, who spoke to our correspondent, Lawan Jibril Adamu, from Barkin Ladi local government area, said they learned a lot at the interactive session which has boosted the understanding between farmers and herdsmen. He said farmers and herders have a lot in common and peaceful coexistence would not only bring about peace but would boost the economy of the nation since farmers and pastoralists (herdsmen) are the agricultural base of the country. A farmer, Jeremiah Michael Bitrus from Mining Camp Gindin Akwati, said there is no doubt there is crisis between farmers and herders, but they have resolved to apply negotiation to every misunderstanding. In his remarks, Mercy Corps Deputy Chief of Party for Community Initiative for Peaceful Coexistence, Sani Suleiman, said the overall focus of the programme is to strengthen the leaders’ capacity to mitigate conflicts at risk communities which has caused devastating consequences on development, democracy, security, economy, human life and climate.
