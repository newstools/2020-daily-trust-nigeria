Hoodlums attacked residents of Anguwar Tiv in Chukuku, Gwagwalada Area Council and carted away their valuables including undisclosed sums of money. A resident of the area, Benjamin Alfred, said the incident occurred on Tuesday evening after a fight broke out at a drinking joint and degenerated into widespread violence. He said a man identified as Julius took a drink and allegedly broke the bottle and when the owner of the drinking spot insisted that he must pay for the bottle he refused. According to Alfred, a fight ensued and attracted the attention of policemen who were on patrol and as they attempted to settle the dispute, they fired the gun to disperse the crowd, injuring one person. “One of the policemen, in trying to settle the matter, shot in the air to disperse the crowd but unfortunately, his bullet hit someone, a situation that angered the youths,” he said. He said the hoodlums then went from house to house destroying shops and carting away electronics, food stuffs, mattresses, phones and other gadgets. A victim, Erdoo Bwa, alleged that the hoodlums attacked the residents and carted away their valuables, threatening to evict them. When contacted, the Gwagwalada Police Area Commander, Sunday Okoebor, said he was not aware of the invasion of Anguwar Tiv in the area, but promised to investigate the incident.
