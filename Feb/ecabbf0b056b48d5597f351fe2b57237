The coalition of the All Progressives Congress Civil Organizations has called on the National Executive Council of the APC to abide by the party’s constitution and allow members vying for the party’s national auditor’s position at a free level playground. It alleged a hatched plan by some executives of the party in Anambra State to manipulate the process of electing successor of Kingsley Moghalu, the party’s national auditor, who is now the Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority. Speaking during the group’s quarterly meeting, the national coordinator of the coalition, Adebayo Segun, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to call those causing unnecessary disagreement within the party in Anambra State to order.
