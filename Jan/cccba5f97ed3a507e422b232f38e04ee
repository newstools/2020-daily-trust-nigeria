The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that the various initiatives being implemented in the 10-year capital market master plan have made the capital market more attractive to investors. Acting Director General Ms. Mary Uduk stated this in a New Year message to capital market operators and stakeholders. “The year 2019 saw us record tremendous results in a number of initiatives largely derived from the 10-year Capital Market Master Plan. These initiatives have helped make the market more attractive, efficient and properly positioned to harness its true potentials. “Through the implementation of interventions such as the Electronic Dividend Mandate Management System (E-DMMS) and the Identity Management System, we have made reasonable success in reducing the huge quantum of unclaimed dividends,” she stated. Uduk said as the capital market journeys through the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has developed a roadmap to guide the industry towards innovation, and embrace a technology-driven approach in the regulatory oversight of the market.
