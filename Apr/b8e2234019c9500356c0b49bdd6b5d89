The governorship aspirant in Anambra State in 2021 of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Ike Oligbo, has faulted the federal government for bringing in Chinese doctors to help combat the spread coronavirus in Nigeria. He stated this while donating some medical equipment at the PDP office in Awka, Anambra State, for onward distribution to the public to assist in containing the spread of coronavirus in the state. He said the Nigerian Doctors were capable of handling the novel virus, if given the necessary support by the federal and state governments. “We don’t need Chinese doctors in Nigeria to fight the spread of the pandemic. Our indigenous doctors are doing well. What they need is financial support and equipment to carry out their duties,” he said.
