In preparation for the reopening of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) had completed the installation of a brand-new category two (CAT2) Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME) to replace the old facilities installed since 2003. The Enugu Airport, one of the international airports in the country, was closed down in August last year, for the construction of the dilapidated runway. Besides the runway, other navigational facilities that would aid aircraft takeoff and landing are being installed. Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika had promised that the Airport would be re-opened by April. NAMA in its Monday bulletin said a successful site acceptance test on the equipment has also been conducted by NAMA engineers in Enugu in preparation for its calibration in the coming days. Furthermore, in order to address communication blind spots in the Lagos South East corridor, the agency has installed a VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) for satellite communication at the airport. This SATCOM (Satellite Communication) node has further been integrated into the national satellite communication network which is linked to the AFISNET (African Indian Ocean SATCOM Network).
