A magistrate court sitting at Igbosere in Lagos State has sent a 22-year-old woman, Olufunmilola Adisa, who was accused of drowning her 21-month-old daughter, Oluwanifemi, in a bucket of water, to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) for psychiatric evaluation. The presiding magistrate, Mrs Dora Ojo, granted the application of the Lagos State Office of the Public Defender (OPD), which is representing Adisa, that the defendant be sent to the Teaching Hospital for necessary psychiatric test to determine her state of mental health. Daily Trust reports that the police arrested Adisa on May 11, 2020, after she had allegedly killed Oluwanifemi, by drowning her in a bucket of water at their Gowon Estate residence, in the Alimosho Local Government Area, Lagos State. The Director, OPD, Dr Babajide Martins, said the Office would be representing the defendant, in line with its statutory responsibility of providing free legal service for the indigent and vulnerable.

The Director further said that though the case had been adjourned till June 26, 2020 awaiting the outcome of the psychiatric examination to be conducted on the defendant, the OPD would do everything within the legal framework to defend Adisa. “This is in consonance with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s commitment that all citizens get access to justice regardless of their socio-economic background,” he said.
