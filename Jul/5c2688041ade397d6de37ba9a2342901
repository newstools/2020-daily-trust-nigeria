The Divisional Police Officer, Aswani Division, Lagos State Command, Chief Superintendent Onyin Francis, on Tuesday distributed various items to the less privileged in the Isolo area of the state. Francis said the gesture was to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown among people residing in her area of responsibility. The DPO said that the Aswani Division had, beyond providing security for the residents, always been known for such gestures, adding, “it is particularly necessary at this critical time to be there for the poor and needy.” She stressed that putting smiles on the faces of the downtrodden had always been a passion for her. Francis donated items including sanitizer, noodles, cooked food and raw beans, to over 500 members of the Aswani community who besieged the Aswani divisional police headquarters, venue of the event. She used the approach, which she codenamed Covid-19 Outreach, to advise the residents to ensure social distancing, wear face masks and sanitize their hands regularly to be safe from contracting the coronavirus disease. One of the beneficiaries, Chinese Agwu, told our reporter that the items given to her would go a long way in solving the problem of hunger in her home. “I came to see for myself if the call for us to come to the Divisional Headquarters to collect palliatives was true. As you can see, I am here with one of my children and we were both given the same things,” she said.
