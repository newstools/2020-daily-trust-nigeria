Green Energy International Limited, (GEIL), the operator of the Otakikpo marginal field in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 11 with operational base at Ikuru town, Rivers State has commenced the execution of the second phase of its field development. The milestone is coming on the heels of the Field Development Plan (FDP) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) approval granted to the company by the oil industry regulator, Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). The full Otakikpo phase 2 development consists of drilling up to seven additional wells, expanding crude processing infrastructure up to 50,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and the construction of 1.3 million barrels capacity onshore terminal. A statement by the company’s Director of Corporate Affairs, Olusegun Ilori said the development would also include the installation of a 17 kilometre export pipeline connecting the terminal to an offshore loading system. It is expected that the first piece of the development will, in the short-term, increase production to up to 12,000 bopd using ullage on existing infrastructure while the long-term will see Otakikpo production of up to 20,000 bopd and opportunities to aggregate production from other producers. The Otakikpo phase 2 field development was sanctioned in July 2019 with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), with a consortium of international firms, valued at $350million. The Consortium will also form multidisciplinary project management teams from Lekoil and GEIL. Commenting on the milestone, the CEO of GEIL Prof. Anthony Adegbulugbe said: “This marks a major step forward for us and our partner, LEKOIL to fully develop the Otakikpo field, we are happy to see our asset moving forward into full development stage and generate significant cash flow.” FG grants GEIL approval for Otakikpo Phase 2 field dev’t Firm signs $350m financing deal to grow oil production, export OML 11 to commence 5,000bpd production soon
