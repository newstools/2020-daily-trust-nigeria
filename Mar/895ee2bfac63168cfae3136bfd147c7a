A former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Austin Okpara, has said that with the peaceful conduct of the ward and local government Congress, PDP is better prepared to take over Edo State in the forthcoming governorship election. Okpara said this yesterday in Benin while addressing journalists on the conduct of the local government congress in the state. “PDP is ready for the forthcoming governorship election and I am sure if you live here and you are from this state, you will know that indeed, you are waiting for PDP to take over,” he said. According to him, PDP is only getting stronger by the day in Edo State, noting that with the outcome of the primary, it has proven that it will always come out stronger. Okpara said from the look of things and the views of some individuals in the state, it was clear that the people were waiting for PDP to come and rescue them from the grip of the APC. He said the congress was largely successful except in one or two local government areas. He appealed to party members who might feel aggrieved as a result of the outcome of the congress to take it in their strides, noting that politics is all about giving and taking.
