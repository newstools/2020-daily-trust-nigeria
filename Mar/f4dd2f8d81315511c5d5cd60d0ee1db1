Sokoto Energy Research Centre (SERC) has trained over 200 women and youths on renewable energy systems and solutions. Acting Director, SERC Mahmud Muhammad Garba, disclosed this on Tuesday while commenting on the training programmes. Garba added that the capacity building initiative included training on solar thermal which he said was the conversion of heat into useful energy. ‘’Solar thermal has different applications including cooking, drying, and electricity generation. We have a lot of materials, and we train youths and women on the use of these systems. “In the area of solar thermal, we collaborated with ECOWAS Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE). In that partnership, we bring some industries together and train them.” “’In Sokoto town here there are two industries. The rice mill industry use part of our solar thermal systems and  our biomass energy-efficient stove. There is also a fabricator who constructs and trains people.” Garba said the centre had been conducting training on solar street light installation. “We have a collaboration with German company GIZ and SERC has been accredited to carry out training in Solar PV installation, Solar PV Supervisors, Mini-grid, Energy Audit and Energy Efficiency. ”There are so many other processes which would create jobs as well. The procedures include briquetting of charcoal. It’s like cake; you will have good combustion and high density. “There is what is called Combined Heat and Power, CHP, you use these residues, provide the heating requirement of the house and you also provide electricity as well.” He said the centre was targeting industries because they consume about 45 percent of power being generated.
