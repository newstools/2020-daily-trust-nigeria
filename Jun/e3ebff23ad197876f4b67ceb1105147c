An official of the  Rivers State University of Science and Technology (RUST), Port Harcourt has told the Bayelsa State Governorship Election Tribunal in Abuja that the deputy governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo graduated from the institution in 1996/1997 academic session. The school official, Fyne Le Amanyie testified yesterday that although Ewhrudjakpo graduated in 199/1997 session, the graduation ceremony took place in 1998. The witness who was led in evidence by counsel to Ewhirudjakpo, Chukwuma-Machukwu Ume (SAN) said he has been a staff of the institution for over 30 years.
