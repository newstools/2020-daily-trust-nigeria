A coalition of Abia North Community Youths Organisations (ANCYO) has told the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF) and Ohanaeze Youths Council (OYC) to steer clear of the politics of the zone or be ready for a shocker. The warning is coming on the heels of recent media reports credited to the National President AYCF,  Shettima Yerima, where he attributed the current ordeals of Senator Orji Uzor Kalu representing Abia North to political witch-hunting. This is as the Ohanaeze Youth Council  in a statement by its Deputy President General, Comrade Obinna Achionye, claimed that “political enemies” were behind  the former governor’s conviction and incarceration. But in a swift reaction, the Abia North group in a statement  by their spokesman, Comrade Udensi Ukpai said “anybody or group trying to attribute Kalu’s ordeal to political persecution is only a meddlesome interloper either hired for a piece of bread or looking for patronage.” Abia: Group tackles Ohanaeze youths over performance of Governor Ikpeazu Abia youths insist on Kalu for Senate Arewa youths: Don’t pitch Buhari against Bafarawa
