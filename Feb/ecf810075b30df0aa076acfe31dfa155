Thousands of supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday led a coalition of civil society organisations under the aegis Civil Society for Rights and Justice (CISORJ) on a prayer session ahead of the Supreme Court verdict on the Imo governorship election. The apex court is expected to hear the appeal filed by the former governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party asking the court to reverse its judgment, which declared Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the governor of the state. The prayer session was led by Rev. Echi Nworgu, Rev. Fr. Wence Isiguzo, and Pastor Rostand Amadi, who asked God to intervene and ensure justice in the matter. Coordinator of the civil society coalition, Anulika Umezurike, speaking at the rally said the judgement since its delivery had thrown the people of the state into mourning.
