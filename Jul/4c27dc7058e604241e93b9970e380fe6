Customers staged a protest on Friday in front of the headquarters of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in Abuja to protest new policy on delivery of company registration certificates introduced due to COVID-19. The customers, including lawyers, brandished placards with inscriptions alleging service inefficiency in the CAC. The CAC had introduced a policy in which company registration certificates would be sent to customers through courier services or electronically to avoid physical contact with clients. Reacting to the protest, the Registrar General, Garba Abubakar, the premises of the commission has  always been overwhelmed with clients which forced the management to take a decision in compliance with the  COVID-19 protocols to stop the spread of the pandemic. “What we have done is to insist on mailing, not have any physical contact with customers any longer. From tomorrow all new certificate will be sent through courier companies and the customers will bear the cost because they are paying for transport or buying fuel to drive themselves to this place, they can as well pay the cost of delivery,” he said. Abubakar said that from August 10, every other process would be done by mailing. CAC’s three-hour business registration plan Lawyers protest server failure at CAC Lawyers laud CAC online reforms
