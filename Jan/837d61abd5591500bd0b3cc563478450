The abducted secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kuje Area Council, Idris Aloma, has regained his freedom after nine days in kidnapers’ den. A member of the victim’s family, who preferred anonymity, told our reporter yesterday that a huge ransom was paid before the victim was set free on Saturday evening. City News had reported that the APC scribe was abducted by armed kidnapers on January 9, 2019, along Zagabutu -Gwargwada road while riding on a motorcycle with his  two children. The family said Aloma was released around 4:37 pm at a forest around Kotonkarfe area of Kogi State, after the kidnappers collected the ransom. “Actually, they collected a huge ransom at a forest around Kotonkarfe area of Kogi State before they released him, but we don’t want to disclose the amount for security reasons,” he said. He said the victim who fell sick as a result of long hours of trekking inside the forest was currently on admission at an undisclosed hospital. The spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, did not pick calls put across to his phone as at the time of filing this report.
