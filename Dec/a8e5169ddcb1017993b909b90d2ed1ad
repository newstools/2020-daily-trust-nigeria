The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano State, yesterday, condemned the recent comments of a Kwankwasiyya factional leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Shehu Wada Sagagi. Sagagi was reported to have alleged that Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje’s administration had allocated lands to people indiscriminately, saying PDP would revoke them when it takes over the state in 2023. Reacting, the State APC caretaker Deputy Chairman, Shehu Maigari, urged the Kwankwasiyya factional chairman not to allow himself to be manipulated like ‘steering wheel’ by others. The PDP Kwankwasiyya faction and Ganduje-led administration have been at loggerheads over allegation of sale of the state’s properties to private individuals. Some of the properties sold by the state so far include Daula Hotel, Triumph Publishing Company and most recently, the effort to sell the state’s zoo with the aim of relocating it outside the city.
