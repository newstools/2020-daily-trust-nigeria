Members of the Shippers Association Lagos State (SALS) have expressed concern over the increasing cost of doing business at the nation’s ports. The President of SALS, Rev. Jonathan Nicol, who made this disclosure while speaking with media men, said the hike in the exchange rate in clearing cargo violated economic decency, adding that the exchange rate had been increased twice within the space of six months. Top on the list of worries is the recent hike in exchange rate to N361 to a dollar by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), describing recent increase and the recent 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) for maritime industry as deadly. Rev. Nicol urged the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency at the Nigerian ports, noting that it negated the ease of doing business stance of the government.

He explained that industries, importers, shippers and exporters would have to source for additional funds to clear their cargo trapped at the ports due to the lockdown order to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Nicol said the excess fund being raised through the customs had no bearing with realities on ground. He said, “All the goods now at the ports should be exempted in this current increase of exchange rate increase. This includes goods that are in the high seas with approved CBN Form M.” Yuletide: Port operators groan over gridlock in Lagos Too many cargo charges affect our profit -Shippers "Ship by pallet" policy to cost Nigeria cargoes
