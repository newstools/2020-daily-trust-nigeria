The APC has returned to the Supreme Court asking the court to reverse its judgment disqualifying David Lyon, its candidate in the 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State. The party’s application was filed yesterday by its team of lawyers led by Chief Wole Olanipekun,SAN. The APC also wants the Supreme Court to set aside the interpretation in its judgment of February 13, and its subsequent execution by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). They are also contending that the apex court misinterpreted the November 12, 2019 judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja which it affirmed. The party argued that the Supreme Court acted without jurisdiction and denied it fair hearing when it proceeded to disqualify its governorship candidate. It also faulted the interpretation given to the Supreme Court judgment by INEC in deciding to issue a certificate of return to the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It further prayed the Supreme Court to set aside the portion of the judgment where it ordered INEC to declare as winner of the governorship election, candidates with the highest number of lawful votes. “Also where it ordered INEC to withdraw the certificate of return issued to its governorship candidate and the issuance of fresh one to the candidate who had the highest number of lawful votes”. The APC argued that it was wrong for the Supreme Court to have voided its candidates’ participation in the election, when, the judgment by the Federal High Court, disqualifying its deputy governorship candidate, was stayed as at when the election was conducted.
