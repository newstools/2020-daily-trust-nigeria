Air travellers who travelled along domestic routes in the country suffered 37,510 delayed flights in 2019 with nine domestic carriers’ total flights peaking at  65,401 flights during the year. This figure was contained in the just published Executive Summary of domestic flight operations released by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The report obtained by our correspondent yesterday showed that during the year, domestic flights increased by 5,582 when compared with 59,818 flights recorded in the previous year. The nine airlines are, Air Peace, Arik Air,  Med-View, Aero Contractors, Overland, Ibom Air, Dana Air, Azman and Max Air. On the international front, 15,474 flights were operated by 33 airlines. But the major highlight of the international flight operations was the record of 41,473 cases of missing/delayed luggage between January and December, 2019. According to the NCAA report, out of the 41,473 missing luggage, 38,440 were found. The report showed that KLM led with 5,060 missing luggage followed by Delta with 4,413 and closely by Air France with 4,406; Lufthansa had 3,054; Royal Air Maroc had 3,041 missing luggage. Turkish Air recorded 2,850 cases of missing/delayed luggage; Egypt Air recorded 2,267 cases; Virgin Atlantic had 1,345; Ethiopian Airline, 1,517; Emirates recorded 1,935, among others. It would be recalled that cases of missing luggage have become a recurring challenge among international carriers, resulting in several confrontations at the airports. Recently, the NCAA issued a suspension warning to Turkish Airlines following the carrier’s frequent cases of missing luggage. The airline narrowly escaped suspension threat by bringing in bigger aircraft to convey backlog of passengers’ luggage left behind in Istanbul, its base. While the international carriers recorded huge cases of missing/delayed flights, the flights operations reduced marginally. 15, 474 flights were operated between January to December 2019 compared to 15, 645 recorded in 2018. This is linked to the suspension of flights by some airlines operating international flights Five airlines including Azman Air,  Flynas Airline, Max Air, Med-View Airline, Mid-Africa Air did not operate in 2019 while two airlines Angola Air and Cabo Verde commenced operations in December, 2019.
