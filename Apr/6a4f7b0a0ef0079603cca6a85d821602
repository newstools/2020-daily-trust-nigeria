To support the efforts of the Lagos State government to provide relief for the poor and the vulnerable due to the COVID-19 induced lockdown, Vava Furniture yesterday donated 1000 boxes of assorted food items to the state. The donation, according to the company, was part of its corporate social responsibility project and the realization that government alone cannot shoulder the responsibility of cushioning the effects of the lockdown. The food items were handed to the officials of the state government at the Ministry of Agriculture warehouse. The items were received by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Gbolahan Lawal, and other officials of the government. The Company Secretary of Vava, Mr Simon James, said the donation was the initiative of the founder of the company, Ambassador Michael Tawadrous. James disclosed that another 500 boxes of the same food items had been donated to the Ogun State government and Noella Foundation to support the emergency relief efforts.
