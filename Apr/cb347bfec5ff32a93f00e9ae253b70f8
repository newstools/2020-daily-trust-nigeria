The Managing Director of Maxifund Securities Limited, Mazi Okechukwu Unegbu, has advised Nigerian banks to grant their debtors interest cut on loans following the huge losses suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered lockdown of the economy. Unegbu, a former President of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) and former bank CEO, canvassed the palliative in the paper he delivered via a Webinar titled ‘COVID-19 and the Future of Banking’ during the monthly forum of the Financial Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN), in Lagos. He said: “They should avoid litigation and sort out themselves through mediation. Banks should tell their debtors something about their plans on managing the interest rate on facilities they have given to them. “All parties, including the banks and their customers, have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no exception. But I expect banks to sit down with their clients and find out ways to enable them to launch back and then settle their indebtedness”, the banking expert advised. According to him, banks should offer their debtors a moratorium on the principal and at least 50 per cent reduction on the interest rates, noting that “banks should get mediators instead of being legalistic,” he said. Unegbu also said Nigeria should encourage, through the banking sector, the promotion of product incubation that would promote local manufacturing rather than relying on importation. It would be recalled that some banks had announced some payment moratorium ranging from 60 to 90 days on some loan portfolio, especially as it affects the Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs).
