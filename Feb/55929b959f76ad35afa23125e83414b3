A suspected phone thief, Kabiru Abdullahi, 28, has been arraigned in a Magistrate Court in Wuse, Zone 6, for allegedly snatching an Uber driver’s mobile phone. The prosecutor, Peter Ejike, told the court that the complainant, Abdul Abel, reported the case at the Wuse Police Station, saying that the defendant tricked him that something fell off his pocket when he alighted from the complainant’s taxi and requested that the complainant helped him with his phone to flash the light. “Upon collecting the phone, the defendant ran away with it, but it was later recovered,” the prosecutor said. The First Information Report read to the defendant stated that the defendant, who resides at Abatcha Estate Wuse Zone 4, is charged for theft contrary to section 257 of the Penal Code Law. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Judge, Njideka Nwosu-Iheme, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N50,000 and a surety who must have a decent job with a traceable address and adjourned the case to  March 24, 2020.
