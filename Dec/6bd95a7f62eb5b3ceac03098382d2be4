Ahead of the 2023 electioneering, a non-partisan women political advancement organisation, ElectHER, has concluded plans to sponsor over 1000 women through capacity building programmes to prepare them to run and win political offices. The group has also commenced a national recruitment programme to get women to run for offices. Co-founders of the group, Abosede George-Ogan and Ibijoke Faborede, disclosed this in Lagos at a press conference to mark the first anniversary of ElectHER. Out of the 1000 women it vowed to support, George-Ogan explained that few of them would be directly sponsored to win elections. According to her, the organisation would set up an election campaign fund to make money available for women to run. Faborede on her part explained that given that there were more experienced male politicians than their female counterparts, the group through its recently launched ElectHER Academy seeks to equip women with the competence and prepare them for the journey ahead.
