The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) promised to ensure complete rehabilitation of  all roads leading into and within the major Gosa dumpsite before the advent of the rainy season. The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, stated this when he inspected the 90.8 hectare Gosa dumpsite in company of senior management staff of the FCTA. A statement by the chief press secretary to the minister, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, said the roads would be rehabilitated so that waste disposal trucks are not hindered from the proper disposal of refuse during the wet season. According to the minister, over 1000 tons of waste from the city are deposited at the dumpsite every day and  the FCTA intends to ensure that the process goes on as smoothly as possible. “We want to make sure that the relevant roads into the dump site are rehabilitated and made stronger, so that at least for the six or seven months when the soil will be very weak and water logged, our vehicles bringing in solid waste from the city will be able to have access and also exit without too much hindrance,” he said. Speaking at the site, Director, Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), Malam Baba Shehu Lawan, said the access road to the dumpsite had been a challenge over the years as the trucks carrying tons of solid waste get stuck in the mud, especially during the rainy season. “The trucks convey the waste at the range of 18 tons to 30 tons each, depending on their capacity. During the rainy season, it’s really a herculean task for these trucks to ply and dispatch their waste. “This visit is so that the minister and relevant management staff can see the damage firsthand and to see that these roads are fixed within the next 10 weeks, when the rain is expected to be in full swing,” he added.  ‘FCT set to begin sustainable waste management’ FCTA prosecutes 1,000 environmental offenders FCT residents decry improper handling of refuse by contractors
