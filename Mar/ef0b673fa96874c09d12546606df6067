The Kaduna State Government has banned the operations of motorcycles and tricycles across the state stressing that the two means of transportation do not satisfy the conditions of social distancing. The Deputy Governor, Dr Hadiza Balarabe who made this known in a state broadcast on Wednesday said commercial buses are for now allowed to operate but warned that they must comply to the new rule of not more than two passengers per row. Dr. Balarabe explained that that decision was taken after senior government officials met to review the level of compliance of the measures taken to contain the spread of COVID 19 and warned that “the government is ready to suspend all forms of pubic transportation if circumstances compel it.” The Deputy Governor recalled that the state government had “requested the appropriate authorities to stop the train services to help curtail the spread of Covid-19 but stressed that: “Further to this, the Kaduna State Government will today(Wednesday) be taking steps to stop the Abuja-Kaduna train service which needs to be suspended for a few weeks.” She said the government has directed all utility vehicles that have been assigned to officials be recalled in order to enhance the state’s capacity for rapid response and contact tracing, monitoring and supervision of surveillance activities should any positive case be identified. According to Dr Hadiza, “payment of salaries for March 2020 has commence” but advised everyone to be financially prudent, given the tough times that lie ahead.” ‘’The state government is committed to getting food and necessities across to identified vulnerable groups should a lockdown become inevitable. The required supplies are being procured while a system of distribution to the persons that most need them is being worked out,’’ she assured.
