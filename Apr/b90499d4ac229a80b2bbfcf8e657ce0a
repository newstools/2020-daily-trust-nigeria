The House of Representatives says it will investigate the ‘mysterious’ deaths recorded in Kano in the past week and investigate measures being taken to tackle the coronavirus pandemic in the state. This was based on a motion moved by the House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa (APC, Kano) at the resumed Plenary on Tuesday. The motion stressed the need to intervene in the health crisis in Kano. The House earlier resolved to summon the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha; NCDC Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu; and the Minister of Health to investigate cause of deaths. However, the motion to summon them was amended and the House committee on health was directed to engage with the PTF on the matter.
