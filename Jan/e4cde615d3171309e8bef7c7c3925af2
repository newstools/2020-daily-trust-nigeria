The Managing Director of the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC), Engr. Fidet Okhiria, has updated the public on the level of additional works done on the Lagos-Ibadan rail project. He said the design of the stations, underpasses and overpasses had changed while anti-theft devices would be installed to reduce the vandalism currently being experienced on the site. “This is not the type of station that is in the initial contract but we encouraged them to continue that the additional works would be approved and they have been approved. All the stations they are currently building were not the initial designs. They were small. “The tracks were not supposed to get to the Port. They were to stop at Ebute Metta but they have been extended. Also, about nine flyovers have been added within Lagos to the contract”, Okhiria added. Recently there have been doubts over the April/May completion date for the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge project. The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, had last week hinted over the development, asking the China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation (CCECC) to speed up the project.
