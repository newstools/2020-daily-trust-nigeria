The Concerned Citizens of Zamfara (CCZ) has reacted to a news report credited to Senator Ahmed Sani Yariman Bakura that members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state should not expect a different judgement from that of the Supreme Court which dismissed the Imo review. Secretary-General of the group, Alhaji Musa Gusau, said the former governor was wrong and urged the leadership of the party in the state to view such statement as anti-party. “We know why Yarima is doing whatever he is doing. He is afraid of the rising profile of former governor Abdulaziz Yari and because he, Yarima has lost his position as the leader of the party, he is trying to cause confusion but he cannot eat his cake and still expect it on the table. “The issue of Zamfara judgement review is entirely different from Imo judgement review. For Zamfara, APC’s application is seeking for review on pre-election matter while that of Imo was an election matter involving missing votes. Again, Zamfara review of judgement involved an affair of intra-party primary election (that is APC and APC and not APC and PDP),” he explained.
