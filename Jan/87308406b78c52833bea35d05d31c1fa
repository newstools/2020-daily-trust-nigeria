A former Vice President and Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party at the 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar has praised the patriotism of fallen soldiers who gave their lives for the country. The Armed Forces Day is observed annually by nations around the world to honour their military forces. In Nigeria, it is marked on January 15 to honour members of the Nigerian Armed Forces who fought in the first and second world wars and those who served or are still serving in various peace support operations worldwide. The day is also marked to appreciate those who fought in the Nigerian Civil War. In a message Atiku posted on his verified twitter handle Wednesday morning to mark the #ArmedForcesRemembranceDay, he said his thoughts and prayers were with the families and friends of the fallen heroes. He wrote: “As always, I remember our fallen heroes who gave their lives for our nation. I remain grateful and indebted for their service and sacrifice. “My thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends. May their sacrifices never be in vain. #ArmedForcesRemembranceDay -AA” As always, I remember our fallen heroes who gave their lives for our nation. I remain grateful and indebted for their service and sacrifice. My thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends. May their sacrifices never be in vain. #ArmedForcesRemembranceDay -AA — Atiku Abubakar (@atiku) January 15, 2020  However, some Nigerians have responded to the tweet with mixed feelings. Some praised him for his love for the country while others were skeptical of his post.
