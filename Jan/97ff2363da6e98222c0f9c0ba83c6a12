The National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) has called on government at all levels to ensure a transformative agenda for women in 2020 to realise the gains of gender equality. The president of the council,  Mrs Gloria Laraba Shoda, in her New Year message to Nigerian women yesterday, said this would help key stakeholders to push for advancement in areas where progress was lacking. She said 2020 would be a historic year for women. “Recent history has shown that transformative change that is important and lasting, takes place only when there is both major investment and attention that rises above partisan concerns. “As a council, we believe that asserting the centrality of investments in women and girls is critical for the health of the country,” she stated. She said rising above the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 indicators to measure progress calls for a fresh, bold, and straightforward agenda for new investment in six key areas to realize progress for women and girls in the country. She urged the global community to identify key actions in areas like politics, reproductive health, genders based violence and education to concentrate upon.
