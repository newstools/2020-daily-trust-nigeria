No fewer than 25,500 Yobe farmers would benefit from the North East Commodity Association dry season farm inputs loan this year. The items to be distributed include seedlings, sprayer, fertilizer, water pump, herbicides and insecticide. The Chairman NECAS Yobe State, Alhaji Nuhu Baba Hassan said  31,000 farmers applied for inclusion into the 2020 plan. Hassan said officials of NECAS and the Central Bank of Nigeria have so far screened about 22,500 beneficiaries across the state who are awaiting for final approval. According to him this year’s selection of beneficiaries focused on farmers in the five local government areas in the northern part of the state who mostly engaged in dry season farming. The chairman urged all the beneficiaries to ensure that they pay back the loan given to them after harvesting their farm produce to enable others to benefit from the programme. He said the association has in the last two years succeeded in supporting many farmers. 11,516 rice farmers benefit from inputs loan in Yobe NECAS recovers 7,000 grains bags to repay CBN loan Fear of ‘dry spell’ grips Yobe farmers
