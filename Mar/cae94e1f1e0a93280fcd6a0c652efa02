The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Katsina has embarked on surveillance to ensure full compliance by petrol marketers with the new pump price of N125 per litre. The Department’s acting Operations Controller, Mallam Aminu Sanusi, said the surveillance was part of its mandate to ensure that consumers of PMS are not cheated by petroleum dealers. According to him, recalcitrant filling station operators will not be spared when uncovered as stipulated penalties will be meted to offenders, noting, however, that the marketers’ compliance rate has been impressive. He said: “There has been substantial compliance across the state, we have not so far seen any outlets selling above the N125 as announced by government but our doors are open for people to reports such station for prompt action. “Our surveillance will continue and be sustained we will comb the nooks and crannies of the state and we want people to support and collaborate in this drive to ensure the commodity is sold at government approved price”, the controller added.
