For the second defendant, Abubakar Aliyu, he was admitted to bail in the sum of N50m; while the third defendant, Rasky Gbinigie, was admitted to bail in the sum of N10m, both with one surety each. For all the defendants, the judge ordered that their sureties must be responsible citizens of Nigeria, residing in Abuja with landed properties and with evidence of tax payment for the last three years. The judge also ordered the defendants to deposit their passports with the court registrar and make an undertaking not to interfere with the prosecution’s witnesses throughout the trial. The sureties were also ordered to enter into an undertaking to always ensure the presence of the defendants in court throughout the trial.
