The Nigerians in Diaspora Organization (NIDO), the United States branch, has expressed disappointment over President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend the issuance of US immigrant visas to Nigerians. NIDO Chairman in the US, Ms. Patience Key, in a statement, said the organization’s disappointment stemmed more from the “systemic failure of Nigeria’s security”. She said: “We are outraged because the Trump Administration has exploited this unsavoury situation in our Nigerian homeland to further its unfortunate agenda of pandering to the most extreme elements of its base.” She said insecurity in Nigeria “has enabled Boko Haram and the ISIS global terrorist network to cause more than 27,000 deaths, while displacing about 2.3 million persons in the last 10 years.” According to her, “”Ranked as the most educated and productive immigrant community in the United States, Nigerian immigrants are overwhelmingly law abiding, hard-working, and ethically-driven”.
