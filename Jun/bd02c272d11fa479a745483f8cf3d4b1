A former Governor of Ekiti State,  Ayodele Fayose has described the crisis being faced by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as a show of God’s anger against the party for its role and that of its government in impoverishing Nigerians, promoting election rigging and looking the other way while Nigerians are being killed in their thousands. Fayose, who was reacting to the APC crisis, said “the party has been displaying power arrogance and treating Nigerians with contempt. This is just the beginning, their matters will be made worse with time.” In a statement on Thursday, by his spokesperson, Lere Olayinka, the former governor said for Nigeria to return to the path of progress that it was before the APC took over power, “more confusion will still hit the party till it goes into oblivion.” Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch.
