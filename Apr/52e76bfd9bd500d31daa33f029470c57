Dr Baloni said the patient who has now been evacuated to the state’s Infectious Disease Centre had travelled to Kaduna in a public transport and had contacted authorities when his symptoms worsened. ”It is very difficult and complicated to trace the contacts of a patient who came from Lagos via public transport and has had some instance of local commuting since his arrival in the state,” she said.
