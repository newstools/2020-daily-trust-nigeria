The Federal Government yesterday expressed worries over the rising cost of importation of barite, noting that it was an anomaly, which is gradually affecting revenue and depleting resources meant for development. Arc. Olamilekan Adegbite, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development stated this in Abuja, during a stakeholders’ forum on local barite development in Nigeria. He added that the ministry’s long-term plan is to place a ban on the importation of barite and close the demand and supply gap that currently exists. According to him, “Evidence from our recent demand and gap analysis shows that out of the total value of Nigeria’s industrial minerals imports in 2016, barite represented 3.6 percent. “The country spends millions of hard-earned dollars every year importing barite, a mineral we are abundantly endowed with in the northern part of the country. “We have mapped out a development strategy towards creating a sustainable industry in Nigeria to support, regulate and monitor stakeholders along the Barite value chain. This process will assist local companies with proven reserves that meet the industry standards to develop capacity. “We are creating a new framework that would promote the local production of barites that meets international acceptable standards.” Nigeria loses N5bn annually to barite importation How mining can close gap created by oil price fall   -  Prof Ofoegbu ‘Nigeria can make $4 bn annually from mining sector’
