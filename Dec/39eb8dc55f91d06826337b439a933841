Senate President Ahmed Lawan on Wednesday swore in Stephen Odey as Senator representing Cross River North Senatorial District in the National Assembly. The oath of office was administered at exactly 11:45 am by the Clerk of Senate, Dauda Ibrahim El-Ladan, immediately after the Senate rose from a closed session to commence plenary. With Odey sworn in, the number of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senators now stand at 46, while the All Progressives Congress (APC) retains majority status with 63 members. It would be recalled that Odey’s swearing-in was put on hold on Tuesday following a court order by the Federal High Court stopping same.
