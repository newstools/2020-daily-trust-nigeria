The House of Representatives yesterday threatened to withhold allocations of ministries, departments and agencies that refused to remit excess and unspent funds contained in their budgets over the years. Chairman, House Committee on Public Accounts, Wole Oke, disclosed this at the resumed investigative hearing of MDAs non-remittance based on the audit queries from the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation. He said: “Despite this workable tripod system for checks and balances, key stakeholders have succeeded in frustrating its smooth operations. “The danger is that if nothing is done to fix this problem, it will create an incentive for MDAs to become reckless and non-accountable to any over-sighting authority.”  Reps grill banks, MDAs over TSA Reps threaten to withhold allocations of MDAs Poor implementation of FoI Act
