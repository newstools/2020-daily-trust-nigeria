The kidnapped officer of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Adamu Suleiman, has been set free while his two children are still being held captive after payment of N2.5 million ransom. City News had reported that the Immigration officer along with his children, Abdullahi and Bilkisu, were abducted two weeks ago, from his Nararati residence in Abaji Area Council. A member of the officer’s family who preferred anonymity, said the kidnappers were still holding the children because the family was unable to pay the negotiated N5m ransom they demanded. He said the officer was released on Wednesday evening on the condition that he would go and source for the N2.5m balance before the children would be set free.
