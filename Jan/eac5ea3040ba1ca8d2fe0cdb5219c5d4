The Lagos State government has described as false the news making the rounds in some quarters of the social media that it has destroyed the statues of the late politician, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and Nigerian music legend and social crusader, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, both of which were erected at the roundabout on Allen Avenue, Ikeja. The state’s Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, told journalists yesterday that “contrary to the malicious claims being spread by ill-informed individuals, the statues were removed for the purpose of development.” Oladeinde said the need to carry out junction improvements in some identified locations necessitated the removal of street furniture, statues of very notable personalities, art works and billboards. The Commissioner noted that the Lagos State government held the nation’s heroes in very high esteem and would not do anything to bring down the exalted heights they attained during their lifetime. “We are in the process of erecting the beautiful work of art depicting Fela Anikulapo-Kuti at the Opebi-Toyin Street junction. The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture is also working on a befitting location to erect the old Obafemi Awolowo statue,” he said.
