The Nasarawa State House of Assembly has passed into law a bill seeking to establish the Nasarawa State Public Procurement Commission in order to ensure transparency and accountability in the purchasing of goods and services by the state government. The Speaker of the assembly, Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, who announced this on Wednesday, said “the passage of the bill into third reading  was due to the importance of Public Procurement Law to societal development.” According to him, Public Procurement Law relates to those legal provisions which regulate the purchasing and the procuring of services and goods by the government, its authorities and its institutions like ministries, departments and agencies. He said that the bill, if finally assented to by the governor, would go a long way in ensuring transparency, accountability as well as equitable distribution of resources across the state. While commending the lawmakers for their support for the bill, the Speaker directed the Clerk of the House to produce a clean copy of the bill for the governor’s assent.
