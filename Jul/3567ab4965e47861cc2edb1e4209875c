Twelve persons were Thursday burnt to death following a fatal motor accident on the Tombia-Ammassoma road in Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. Also, nine persons were reported to have been burnt to death on the spot when a diesel tanker exploded after colliding with a 14-seater bus. Three others later died at the Niger Delta Teaching Hospital, Okolobiri. Daily Trust gathered that the incident, which occurred on Wednesday night, involved the diesel tanker truck believed to be conveying chippings to a construction site around the Ammassoma area. Witnesses told newsmen that the accident occurred at about 8.45pm, along Tombia/Ammassoma road, close to the Airport Junction. “The bus and the diesel tanker collided and the bus burst into flames. Everybody on the bus was trapped and burnt beyond recognition except for three survivors. They also later died.” An official of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) confirmed the incident, saying the affected passengers were unrecognisable. “When we arrived at the scene at about 10 pm, there was nothing we could do,” he said. FRSC officials confirmed that preliminary investigation showed that over speeding on the part of the diesel truck contributed to the accident. “We believe the truck driver removed the plate number and escaped from the scene of the accident. But the passenger bus carried plate number VA6243.” Also, spokesman of the police command in Bayelsa, SP Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident. 2 burnt to death as tanker catches fire at Lambata Six persons killed, 10 injured in Gombe truck accident 11 supporters of Mrs Jonathan die in auto crash
