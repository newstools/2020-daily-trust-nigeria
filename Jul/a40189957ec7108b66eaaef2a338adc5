Kidnappers of the daughter of a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Gimba Salihu Bako, have demanded for N2 million as ransom. City News had reported that the APC chieftain’s daughter, Hasiya Gimba, was abducted on Monday around 2:25 am at Chiji village in Abaji Area Council by armed men that invaded her uncle’s house while she was on a visit. The father of the victim told our reporter, yesterday, that he met with his in-law on Wednesday after contact with the kidnappers was established, adding that negotiation was still on. “In fact, even this morning, my in-law called and told me that the kidnappers called him and were demanding for N2 million ransom, but we are still negotiating with them,” he said. Efforts to confirm the development proved abortive as spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, did not pick calls put through to him.
