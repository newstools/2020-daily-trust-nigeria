Adams Oshiomhole has warned that police be on the lookout for thuggery late Saturday when ballots start being collated in Edo. He spoke of speculations that “the criminals will arrive to cause intimidation towards the collation time.” He commended voter attitude and security at his polling unit but berated the elections regulator INEC for card reader malfunction. While speaking to the press after voting, Oshiomole commended the effort of security operatives and the cooperation of the electorates for the peaceful atmosphere. He also hit hard on INEC for being “the only bad egg” as most card readers are not functioning properly at his polling unit, thereby slowing down the process. He voted at 10:55am at PU 001, Ward 10 in Uzairue north east, Etsako West local government area.
