The country has the highest confirmed positives in the world, with more than 347,003 cases of the virus and 10,335 deaths related to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by it. Public health officials and the White House are warning that the upcoming weeks will likely see peak coronavirus outbreaks and hospitalisations in the U.S., with the death rate also set to sharply climb. There are growing signs of impending shortages of medical gear and staff. The U.S. had just 1,000 confirmed cases and about 30 deaths on March 10, with the outbreak spreading rapidly and across the country.
