To stop recurring vandalisation of materials used in the ongoing construction of the Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge railway line by hoodlums, the Federal Government has constituted a Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to beef up the protection of the multi-million dollar project. The deployment of NSCDC is aimed at safeguarding the critical national assets and infrastructure of the corporation, Deputy Director, Public Relations of the NRC, Mr. Yakub Mahmood, told our correspondent. Daily Trust reports that the corporation recently cried out that some criminal elements were destroying and stealing clips, bolts and knots. About 10,000 bolts, 5000 clips and knots have been replaced, it was learnt. The inauguration of the NSCDC command in Lagos was conducted by the Commandant-General of NSCDC, Mr. Abdullahi Gana, who was represented by a Deputy Commandant General, Mr. K.S Aminu, as part of measures to stop the theft of NRC equipment. The Managing Director of NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, represented by the Director of Operations, Mr. Niyi Alli, assured the management of NSCDC of the commitment of NRC towards provision of necessary logistics such as office and residential accommodation for smooth takeoff of the command. Alli said officials of the corps should consult with the management of the corporation whenever there was security threat. Responding, DCP Aminu assured the management of the corporation of readiness to tackle security challenges and threats on NRC facilities. He, therefore, solicited the cooperation of other sister security agencies and staff of the corporation in the gathering of intelligence towards total eradication of vandalism and other criminal activities within the railway corridor.
