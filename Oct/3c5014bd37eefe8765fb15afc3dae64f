The European Union governments on Monday thrown their weights behind Nigeria’s former finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running for the director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This is coming shortly before the organisation announces the two finalists today (October 6), and would further name a winner by November 7. According to Bloomberg, the EU disclosed this in Brussels, saying it would support the Nigerian and South Korean candidates to lead the World Trade Organization as the race enters its final month. EU member-country envoys endorsed Okonjo-Iweala and Yoo Myung-hee, South Korea’s trade chief, in their bids to become WTO director-general, according to an official familiar with the matter. The platform reports that five candidates are still on to head WTO.
