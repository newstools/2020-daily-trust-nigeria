The Commonwealth Secretariat has said though technology brings both benefit and risk to elections, there are solutions that can defend the process from cybersecurity threats. This is contained in a Commonwealth best practice guide to cybersecurity in elections. In a statement by Simon Bull of the Communications Division of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the product has been developed to help election management bodies identify and manage cybersecurity risks. According to the statement, technology has become a common and often indispensable part of elections which includes e-voting machines, biometric scanners, mobile phones, electronic voter registration databases and social media platforms. The statement explained that the guide covers technical systems, laws and policies, and capabilities across the whole electoral cycle and offers a raft of recommendations that can be tailored to national contexts to help professionals who run elections.
