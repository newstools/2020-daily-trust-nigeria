Two Chinese nationals  –  Yang Liang Ming, 41 and his elder brother, 45-year-old Wang Gui-Moi  –  are cooling their heels in a police cell for allegedly having anal sex with one of their colleagues. It was gathered that the suspects’ arrest followed a petition to the police at the Area ‘F’ Command by one of their roommates, Jun Lan-Yin. Lan-Yin alleged that the suspects forcefully made love to him through the anus while he was deep in sleep. Our correspondent learnt that upon receipt of the petition, detectives, led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Olasoji Akinbayo, began investigation and eventually arrested the two suspects. Although Ming and Gui-Moi denied the allegation during interrogation, the police alleged that investigation supervised by ACP Olasoji revealed that there was sexual assault by the two suspects. A medical test said to have been conducted at the Mirabel Medical Centre, Lagos State Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), was understood to have confirmed that Lan-Yin had been sexually assaulted by his colleagues through the anus. Investigation further, allegedly, revealed that the suspects had a record of gay activities at their former place of work, which the police said had expressed its readiness to testify against them if necessary. The Chinese nationals who were paraded before news men in Lagos, according to the Area Commander, Area F, Olasoji Akinbayo, would be charged to court at the end of Investigation.
