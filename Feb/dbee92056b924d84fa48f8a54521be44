The Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) has given assurance on following all due processes and liaising with the Bureau for Public Procurement (BPP) regarding the procurement process for all road repair contracts in the 2020 budget that would not otherwise be done through direct labour. FERMA’s Managing Director, Engr. Nuruddeen Rafindadi, stated this when members of the House of Representatives Committee on FERMA paid an oversight working visit to the agency’s head office in Abuja on Tuesday. The MD who expressed delight with the visit and the interest of members on the oversight budget and indirect labour interventions by FERMA in all the states, said lack of funds was hindering the speedy repair work needed, adding that projects were identified on requirement and submission by engineers on the field. Members of the committee, led by the Chairman, House Committee on FERMA, Hon. Femi Bamisile, called for specifics on projects in their various constituencies, level of work in terms of percentage, and made various observations on the level of work in their communities. Some members appealed to the agency not to start projects and abandon them midway due to lack of funds, as doing so would only make the roads to further deteriorate. Amid praises and criticism from members of the committee, some said the Procurement Act, if not implemented, would make nonsense of the 2020 budget that had already been signed, and called for speedy commencement of the procurement process that would lead to contracts award.
