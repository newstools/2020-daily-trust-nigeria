Twenty suspected members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) have been arrested for allegedly causing mayhem on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The suspects were alleged to have set fire on used tyres in the middle of the road on Monday January 6, 2020 and causing motorists to panic. The activities of the union members were also said to have caused heavy vehicular hold-up on the expressway. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, told journalists at a press conference held yesterday at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, that policemen recovered weapons that included axes, daggers, broken bottles and cutlasses from the suspects. Odumosu warned the leadership of the various transport unions in the state to restrict their activities to their Secretariats as anyone arrested would be made to face the wrath of the law. He also advised the leaders of the various factions to find a peaceful way of resolving their differences.
