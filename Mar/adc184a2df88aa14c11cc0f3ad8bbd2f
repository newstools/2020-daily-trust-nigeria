A Lagos High Court sitting in Igbosere on Thursday struck out a contempt of court proceedings filed against the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus and Senator Ben Obi. Justice Taofikat Oyekan-Abdullahi had on December 5, 2019 ordered the PDP Chairman Secondus, and a member of NWC of the party, Senator Ben Obi to show cause why an order for committal should not be made against them. The judge ordered that Secondus and Sen Obi should come and explain before the court why they should not be committed to prison for disobeying its order. The order was due to alleged disobedience to the court’s order of November 12, 2019 which restrained Secondus and the party’s NWC from conducting a special election for the vacant offices in Lagos PDP. On the last adjourned date on February 10, Secondus appeared before the court to stop the committal proceedings. The court had on November 12, ordered that all parties should maintain peace, and status quo with regards to the special election being planned by the party to elect new executives. Dr. Adegbola Dominic insisted that he remained the chairman of the party and challenged the proposed congress in court. Justice Oyekan-Abdullahi expressed dismay that Lagos PDP proceeded to conduct the special election despite knowledge of the case and pending application for interlocutory injunction.
