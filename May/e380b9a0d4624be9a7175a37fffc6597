The Lagos State government says it has prosecuted about 185 cases in March and April 2020 from three magisterial districts of Ogba, Ebute-Meta and Ikorodu. This is contained in the monthly report of district prosecutors that the state Ministry of Justice released yesterday. The ministry’s Director of Public Affairs, Kayode Oyekanmi, said in a statement he issued yesterday on the report that prosecution of the 185 cases was approved after they had been filtered by the district prosecutors assigned to the magisterial courts. Oyekanmi said that the creation of District Prosecutors on March 3, 2020 as a sub- unit under the Department of Public Prosecution to operate in a pilot scheme involving three magisterial areas of the state was adopted as part of the recommendations of the Arthur Worrey-led Advisory Committee on police prosecutorial power in magistrate courts, which was inaugurated in January 2020 by the Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice.

The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo, had, during submission of the report of the Arthur Worrey committee, said, “The operations of the district prosecutors would enhance speedy prosecution of cases before the court. It will also ensure the striking out of cases that disclose no prima facia evidence of offences committed.” Onigbanjo added that the district prosecutors would, henceforth, take over the prosecution of severe and grievous criminal matters before the court.
