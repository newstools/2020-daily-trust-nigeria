Director General of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Joseph Ari, has unveiled the second phase of the ITF revised vision and strategies for mandate actualisation. Speaking at the event, the DG said the reviewed vision was expected to terminate in 2022 but that in view of the numerous challenges that COVID-19 has wreaked on the world and altered so many things, the reviewed document had to be reviewed again so that it can properly propel the desired achievements. Commenting on some of the Fund’s other achievements, Ari said that over 500,000 Nigerians had been trained on technical vocational skills, saying that 80% of them are living sustainably either as paid employees or employers of labour. He said due to the bleak unemployment outlook occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in line with their mandate as well, the management constituted a committee to thoroughly review the reviewed vision and take into cognisance the pitfalls of the first phase and the many challenges that are confronting the organisation and the economy at large. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. Ari said the pandemic has not only claimed lives, but has also wiped out whole industries and sources of livelihood of many,  hence the urgent need for another review as a result of the emerging realities because in Nigeria there are projections of a rise in unemployment and job loss. “What emerged from the committee’s deliberation is the document that we are confident will fully address some of these challenges and drive the current policy direction of the federal government”, he said.
