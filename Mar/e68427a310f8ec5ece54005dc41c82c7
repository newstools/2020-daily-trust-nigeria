The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) said it has complied with the order capping estimated billing introduced by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). The General Manager, Corporate Communications of AEDC, Mr Oyebode Fadipe, was reacting to complaints brought to it by customers around the Jabi axis in Abuja about over billing. The shop owners in the area said they are being charged above N11,000 and are being intimidated with threats of disconnection by the DisCo’s field officers. However, a record of the new estimated bill limit for customers shows that commercial customers in Jabi under AEDC would be charged N10,370 every month. The computation shows that at N37.39 per one kilowatt hour (kwh) of energy, AEDC said the customers comprising mostly shop owners may consume an estimated 258kwh and so should pay the N10,370 estimated bill. But in his response, Fadipe said the capping of estimated bill was an order by NERC that AEDC was obeying. He further explained that NERC had pegged the maximum amount certain areas will pay per month for electricity supply. “The capping is a NERC order. It is an order we are bound to obey. As for the one that you allege is above the NERC cap, I need to see it,” Fadipe said.
