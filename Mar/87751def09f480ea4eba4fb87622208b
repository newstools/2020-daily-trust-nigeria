Director General of the Voice of Nigeria (VON) Osita Okechukwu, has replied the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, over his claim that those plotting the removal of the party’s suspended national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, were afflicted with the 2023 virus. Reacting to Tinubu’s statement yesterday in Abuja, Okechukwu said Oshiomhole was actually the virus that has afflicted the APC and not 2023. “With greatest respect to our national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, we are passionate and loyal members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the grassroots level. Permit us to state without equivocation that, hitherto we held Comrade Adams Oshiomhole in high esteem and had high expectations of optimum performance and quality leadership from him. That explains why we the APC delegates nationwide unanimously and consensually elected him as sole chairmanship candidate two years ago. “It is therefore with deep regret that two years down the line, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, now a bull in the china shop, in utter disregard to the high expectations of the responsibility entrusted on him, and the constitution of the APC has today committed without remorse or introspection 10 monumental cardinal sins against our great party, APC. If there is virus as our revered Asiwaju proclaimed? It is more of Osho-virus than 2023 virus!” Okechukwu, who also a member of the Oshiomhole-must-go camp, enumerated what he called 10 Osho-viruses including flagrant violation of the party’s constitution, revival of PDP, improper management of the party’s primaries, insincerity and erosion of Buhari’s votes bank, among others.
