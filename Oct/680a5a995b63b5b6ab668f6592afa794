Youths identifying as#BringbackSARS, had descended on the #ENDSARS protesters a few minutes before 5 pm, holding sticks and other arms that saw the protesting youths taking to their heels. Protesting youths ran into town through the NNPC junction. Hundreds of young protesters had earlier passed through Gado Nasko Way, a main road within the town at around 9 am. They converged on the expressway and blocked it with cars. They blared music from their cars, danced and chanted slogans. Hundreds of motorists were stranded up till noon when this report was first filed. A lone police van was sighted at the junction. Another van and a police team parked metres on the axis leading into the city. Protesters said their demand was no longer restricted to ending SARS but looking for good governance. One, a 400-level student of the University of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, said he was tired of sitting idle.
