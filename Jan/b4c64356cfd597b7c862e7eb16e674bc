The founder of the Single Parenthood Global Foundation (SPGF), Queen Obaseki, has cautioned Nigerians against producing children that they are not prepared to cater for. She made the plea in Abuja yesterday at the unveiling of the foundation. According to her, it is an act of irresponsibility for a man to put a girl in a family way and abandon her to cater for the child alone, likewise for women who abandon their children for men. Miss Obaseki lamented the stigma and suffering single parents go through in raising their children, saying those challenges are most times responsible for girls dumping their children or going into prostitution to make ends meet. She advocated for a law that would compel men and women to take responsibility for the children they bring forth, especially those born out of wedlock. She explained that the foundation is aimed at empowering poor female and male single parents and their children as well as carry out advocacy towards checking the rising trend of single parenthood. Engr. Jackson Olaye who chaired the occasion, noted that the foundation would enhance the emotional and socio-economic wellbeing of single parents.
