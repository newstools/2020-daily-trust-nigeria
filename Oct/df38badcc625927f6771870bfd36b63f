The chairman of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi State, Alhaji Uba Ahmed Nana, has debunked a report that the 20 members of his party at the state house of assembly would defect to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). With 21 members, APC dominates the state House of Assembly. Recently, one lawmaker was killed. PDP has nine and New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) has one. Addressing newsmen shortly after holding a meeting with the 20 APC lawmakers, Alhaji Nana said the speculations about planned defection of the lawmakers was baseless.
