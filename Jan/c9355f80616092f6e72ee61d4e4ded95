Kogi State stakeholders under the aegis of Coalition of Development Associations have called on Governor Yahaya Bello to channel his energy towards developing infrastructure and improving the standard of living of the people. The chairman of the coalition, Dr Adeiza Abdul-Rahman, who is also the president-general of Ebira People’s Association (EPA), said there was the need for the governor to reciprocate the massive support Kogites gave him in the just concluded election by addressing the general infrastructural decay across the three senatorial regions of the state. “First and foremost, while he is working on security, we also wish that he focuses on infrastructural development of the entire state because that is the only way that you can ensure that there is investment in this state. “Once he can do that, we will also appeal to him again to ensure that the tourism potentials of this state are fully harnessed because a lot of things are in this state that can attract a lot of investments but without security and without reasonable infrastructure, I think we’ll not be able to do that,” he said.
