The prosecutor added that the two men also attempted to kill Gildas Tohouo-Tohouo by stabbing him many times on the neck, head and back with a knife and a dagger and hitting him with a hammer on his head. The Commissioner of Justice alleged that the defendants violently robbed Gildas Tohouo-Tohouo and Bernadetta of many items, including foreign currencies in different denominations.
