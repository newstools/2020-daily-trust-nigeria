The Ekiti State Police Commissioner, Mr Asuquo Amba, has called for absolute respect for human rights as the COVID-19 restriction order continues in the state, following reported cases of alleged maltreatment of some traders by security agents enforcing the lockdown restriction. Amba, who commended the residents for complying with the extension of the lockdown as pronounced by Governor Kayode Fayemi on Monday, said the strict adherence had reduced the level of arrests, contrary to what was witnessed in the first 14 days. Amba, who spoke through the Command’s Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Sunday Abutu, yesterday said he had been moving round the state since the extension to ensure that no citizen was molested by any security agent. Abutu stated, “the Commissioner has been moving round the state to ensure that the rights of the people are not trampled upon. Protection of human rights is part of our statutory duties. “Though our men and officers are on national duty to enforce restriction of movement, this does not mean that the rights of the violators should be infringed by way of maltreatment. The police won’t tolerate that. “We have sensitized our men on duties all over the state on the need to be civil and they are complying with this directive, going by the security reports we are getting. “We appeal to the residents to stay at home and to use the window opened for them between 6am and 2pm on Thursday to go out and restock, rather than flouting the lockdown order. “We are particularly happy that the residents are complying and that was why we have not made any serious arrest since the extension started on Monday.” Covid-19: Compliance rate on restriction order in Ekiti 60 per cent — Police Commissioner Ekiti gets new CP, Amba Three teachers arrested for allegedly raping students in Ekiti schools
