A top UN prosecutor said on Saturday that the arrest of a key Rwanda genocide fugitive in France showed that suspects would be brought to justice for crimes in the 1994 bloodshed. “The arrest of Felicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even 26 years after their crimes,” said Serge Brammertz, chief prosecutor of the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT) in The Hague. “Today’s arrest underlines the strength of our determination.” The prosecutor praised French authorities, saying the arrest “could not have been made without their exceptional cooperation and skill”, and also thanked other countries and international organisations that helped.
