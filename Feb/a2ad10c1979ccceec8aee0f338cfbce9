A 19-year-old suspected burglar, Isiaka Olalekan, who was arrested for allegedly stealing four expensive phones from his master’s shop, has said it was hunger that compelled him to commit the act. The police quoted Olalekan, who a police patrol team arrested last Friday on the Third Mainland Bridge, as saying, “Hunger forced me into breaking into my master’s shop, where I stole four phones. The thought of breaking into the shop came into me because I did not eat anything for two days.” The police alleged that the suspect broke into the shop of his master, Farouk Nobi, on February 6, 2020 at about 7.15pm and stole four expensive mobile phones. The shop is located at No. 287, Boboreji Market, Lagos Island. Luck, however, ran against him while he was escaping as he was arrested on the Third Mainland Bridge by the police patrol team. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the arrest, said Olalekan had confessed to the crime.     Elkana said the suspect would soon be charged to court.
