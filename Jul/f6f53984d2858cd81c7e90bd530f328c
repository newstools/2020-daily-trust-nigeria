The Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) has donated medical equipment worth $150,000 to the Bayelsa State Government in order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. Receiving the medical items from the company’s delegation, Gov. Douye Diri, who was represented by the Deputy Chief of Staff, Government House, Dr. Peter Akpe, described the donation as symbolic. Gov. Diri said the NLNG gesture would strengthen the existing relationship between the state and the organisation considering the huge gas deposits being exploited in the state. The governor’s acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as saying that the ongoing fight against the spread of the virus could be reduced to the barest minimum if all hands, including organisations like NLNG, partnered with government. Earlier, the NLNG General Manager, External Relations, Mrs. Iyono Fatai-Williams, said the donation was part of the oil industry’s joint intervention to support the state Ministry of Health and the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital in the fight against the virus.
