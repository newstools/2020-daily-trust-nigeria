About 200 Nigerian citizens stranded in Canada hoping to return home on Thursday will have to wait as their evacuation flight has been postponed. The Nigeria High Commission in Ottawa, which is organising the flight, announced the postponement in a statement, citing “logistics issues” beyond its control. It specifically blamed the inability of Air Peace – the chosen carrier – to secure “overflight and landing permits” from the Canadian authorities on time. “These challenges are as a result of the fact that Air Peace is flying this route for the first time.

It said a new date would be announced as soon as the airline secure the clearance from the Canadian authorities. The plane, a Boeing 777 aircraft, was scheduled to fly from Lagos to convey the passengers from two locations in Canada, namely Toronto and Alberta. According to the flight schedule, the plane was expected to pick the first set from the Pearson International Airport, Toronto. From there it would fly to the Calgary International Airport, Alberta, a distance of 2,915 k.m., to pick the second set of passengers. The prospective passengers had been given until Tuesday to book the special flight directly with the airline.
