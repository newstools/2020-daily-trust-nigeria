The Indigenous youths of the Federal Capital Territory have debunked claims that they were behind the recent violence that erupted in parts of the territory, following clashes between pro SARS and #EndSARS protesters. The group, Indigenous People of FCT Youths Representatives, denied that they were sponsored to attack peaceful protesters. The group led by Yunusa Yusuf, had over a week ago issued an ultimatum to the #EndSARS protesters to leave the streets of Abuja.
