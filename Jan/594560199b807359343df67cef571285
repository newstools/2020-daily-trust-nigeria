Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) residing in Gurku, a Nasarawa State village on the fringes of Abuja, have appealed to the Federal Government to restore peace in their homelands so that they can go back. The IDPs who said they were tired of living under dire conditions in camp, said they were homesick and wanted to return to their homes in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States. Speaking yesterday when the President, Defence and Police Officers Wives Association (DEPOWA) Dr. Omobolanle Olonisakin paid a visit to the camp, the coordinator, Yohanna Zidiko, who spoke on behalf of other IDPs said  they preferred going back home to resume their normal activities to earn their livelihood. He said they were not comfortable in the camp as most of them had no means of livelihoods hence they preferred returning to their bases. He also said most of the IDPs suffer illness such as malaria and typhoid but have no money for treatment and appealed to the visitors to assist the IDPs in the area of health. On her part, DEPOWA president, Olonisakin said the government was making frantic efforts for them to return home. She called for support to the military who had always risked their lives to keep the region and the entire nation safe. She said the association was dedicated to providing succour to the less privilege in the society by providing the basic needs for them.
