An Ibadan-based Islamic cleric, Sheik Taofeeq Akewugbagold, has narrated how he recovered his 28-month-old twins from their abductors at 5.30am yesterday. The twins were released eight days after some gunmen abducted them at their father’s residence at Ojoo, Ibadan, on April 25. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, said the release was secured through spirited efforts of police personnel. Akewugbagold had earlier said the abductors, whom he observed spoke in fluent English that showed they were well read, demanded a ransom of £100,000 to secure the release of the children.

We were begging them on a daily basis to reduce the ransom. They asked for £100,000 (about N55 million). Since then, we have been begging them.
