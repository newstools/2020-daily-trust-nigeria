Suspected armed bandits have killed four soldiers in an ambush in Zurmi Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Daily Trust gathered. A source familiar with the development told Daily Trust that the soldiers were conveying food supplies to their colleagues carrying out operation codenamed ‘Hadarin Daji’ in the forest. It was gathered that the soldiers were ambushed by the armed bandits in a forest near Garin-Kada and Birane villages in Zurmi Local Government Area. “Taking advantage of their knowledge of the rough terrain inside the forest, they lurked around until the troops reached a certain spot before they opened fire on the vehicles conveying them and four soldiers died on the spot. However, the troops responded and killed dozens of the gunmen and recovered about 8 AK47 rifles. “The Force Commander of Operation Hadarin Daji (OPHD), who is also the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division, Sokoto, Brig. Gen. Aminu Bande has visited the scene, perhaps to assess the situation,” he added. 4 soldiers killed in Zamfara ambush Troops kill 15 bandits in Zamfara Zamfara peace talks: Military to sustain operations against bandits in North West
