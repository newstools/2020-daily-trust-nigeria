National Chairman of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) Alhaji Falalu Bello has said the continuous lockdown ordered by government is not a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The former top shot in the banking industry, in a statement yesterday, said the spike in confirmed cases of the pandemic, despite the lockdown, should inform policymakers in the country that lockdown with attendant economic costs was not working and needed serious re-examination. He said lack of testing facilities in the nation must be addressed if any meaningful achievement is to be recorded in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. “The PRP loudly requests the federal government in the next 45 days to build a Molecular Ward in all the senatorial districts of Nigeria to be scaled up to 774, in all local governments in the next 180 days, all at the expense of the local governments so as to have uniformity of standards and enjoy the economy of scale. “This is doable, affordable and must be done if we are serious as a nation and we urge all state governments to pursue and support this instead of barking orders and flexing muscles as if we are in a military government. “It is morally, nay legally wrong in accordance with some scriptures to lock up anyone without providing such a person with sustenance. If governments cannot provide for sustenance for the people they are locking up, they have no moral right to lock them up just because the quarantine law gives them the right to order quarantine. “If sustenance is not provided for the citizens locked up, the PRP will go to court on behalf of the Nigerian ‘talaka’ to test whether the governments have the right to quarantine anyone without feeding him,” he said.
