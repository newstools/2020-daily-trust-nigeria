The Coalition for Democracy and Development (CDD) has charged Nigerians to support the country’s Service Chiefs in the fight against terrorism amidst what it termed conspiracy by disgruntled politicians. The Coalition made this known at a press conference on Sunday in Abuja, raising an alarm over alleged plot by some individuals and groups to disintegrate Nigeria through the sponsoring of acts of terrorism. In a statement signed by Director Enlightenment, Dr. Grace Ojukwu, CDD revealed that the group is happy with the gains made by the military in the fight against terrorism since the advent of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. “The Coalition for Democracy and Development wishes to inform the members of the general public of the despicable plot by some disgruntled individuals and organizations that are determined to see to the disintegration of Nigeria through the sponsoring of acts of terrorism in Nigeria. These individuals and organizations are not happy with the gains made by the Nigerian Military in the fight against terrorism in Nigeria since the advent of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and as such they have been in the vanguard of sponsoring acts against National Interest all aimed at causing disaffection in the polity,” the group alleged. The group implored Nigerians to come out in number to challenge anyone protesting against service chiefs in the country.
