For failure to comply with the government’s approved petrol pump price and alleged sharp practices, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has sanctioned six petrol stations and outlets in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. The Operations Controller of DPR in Yenagoa field office, George Ene-Ita, who led team of surveillance officers on routine inspection of petrol stations in the state, said two of the filling stations were totally shutdown for selling above government approved price while four others had some pumps sealed for under-dispensing. He, however, commended the NNPC mega station in Amarata axis of Yenagoa and its affiliate in Tombia for complying with government’s directives on the pump price and also dispensing the products properly to the public. He said the DPR will continue to work on it mandates to ensure that the public are not shortchanged, and see to it that all petrol dealers complied with government regulations. He said: “We want to assure Bayelsans that the pump price of patrol is N125 per litre and it has been strictly adhered to, only one filling stations was found to be in violation, and that filling station has been sealed, another was also shut down for under-dispensing, but the compliance level in Bayelsa State is high. “For the erring stations to return to business, they have to comply, for those of them that are under-dispensing, they have to call their engineers to readjust their pumps, once that is done, and we satisfied that they have complied, we will open them, but in cases that infraction is quite high, they will have to pay a fine”, the regulatory officer added.
