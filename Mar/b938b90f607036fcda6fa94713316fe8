The Association of Resident Doctors, Federal Capital Territory Administration (ARD-FCTA) has called on the FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, to wade into the issues that led to its industrial action. President of the Association, Dr Roland Aigbovo, made the call while briefing newsmen in Abuja. The industrial action commenced on Tuesday in the 14 districts and general hospitals, and the department of public health and primary health care development board under the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA). He said members of the association were thrown into serious financial distress because of the non-payment of their salaries as at when due. He said:  “We waited patiently after the end of year 2019 and new year 2020 celebrations, till third week of February, only for us to receive a paltry sum of money as January salary. The money received range from one-fifth to one-tenth of our salary with the exclusion of the newly employed members who have not been paid for about five to seven months.” Dr Aigbovo said an emergency general meeting of the association held yesterday and the members agreed that until all their demands were met, the indefinite strike action would continue. He said the FCTA management had blamed the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) at the office of the accountant-general of the federation, for the problem adding however that the IPPIS platform came to be since 2007 and all teething problems should have been resolved by now.
