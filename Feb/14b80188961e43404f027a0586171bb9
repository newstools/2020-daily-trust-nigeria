Osinbajo, in a statement by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, said this was part of an ongoing deliberate and comprehensive consolidation of the security situation in the country. “We’re doing everything that needs to be done. We’re handling security well, and as you know, including military deployment in diverse fields, like the Boko Haram in the northeast. “In fact, we’ve to now recruit more into the army, and much faster than we ever did because we need men on the ground; resources also – to buy more arms, to buy more platforms,” he said. He said that at the last meeting of the National Security Council held on Thursday, “we had discussions on how to beef up the military’s platforms. How do we beef up the numbers? How do we recruit more men and women into the army? How do we collaborate more with local vigilante, the Civilian Joint Task Force and all that. “So, there’s a lot going on in terms of trying to beef up security. The security situation is one that’s very challenging. We’re also looking at aspects of surveillance – how we can do more aerial surveillance using drones and electronic devices to improve surveillance.”  Insecurity: FG to recruit more troops – Osinbajo Armed banditry: Zamfara to recruit 8,500 civilian JTF members N-power: We’re targeting 120,000 graduates in Kano – Osinbajo
