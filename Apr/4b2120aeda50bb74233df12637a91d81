Unknown assailants strangled a housewife, Mrs. Echenemi Ojor, to death, at Kekeshi, Abaji Area Council. A resident of the area, who preferred anonymity, said the woman’s body was found around 6 am on Saturday, a few metres from her church. He said part of the woman’s face, down to her breast was burnt and that he suspects that the woman might have been strangled. “Actually, when I visited the scene, there was no sign of injury on her body. I think that they strangled her and later set her ablaze,” he said. Our reporter gathered from neighbours of the late Ojor, that the mother of three children left her house at about 9:47 pm on Friday, after she received a phone call. Mrs. Grace Ayuba, a neighbour of the deceased, asaid the late woman received an anonymous phone call and left the house and did not return, only for  her body to be found at Kekeshi. “It is quite unfortunate that this woman did not have problem with any tenant in this house. In fact, even when she left the house according to one of her sons, she left her phone at home,” she said. The deceased husband, Christopher Augustine, while speaking with our reporter at the police station, said he communicated last with his wife on Thursday, while he was at his work place in Okene, Kogi State. “Actually, I received her text message last Thursday, until on Saturday morning when a call came in from my in-law that my wife is dead,” he said.
