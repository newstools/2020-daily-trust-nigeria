The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Anambra State chapter, has warned Governor Willie Obiano against politicizing the sharing of the federal government’s lockdown palliatives to the people of the state. The state government had at the weekend received 1,800 bags of 50kg rice and 2,400 cartons of tomato paste as part of its share of the federal government’s palliatives to cushion the effect of the lockdown in the state. It was gathered that the Deputy Governor, Dr Nkem Okeke, took the delivery of the items on behalf of the state government. The party, in a statement by its publicity secretary, Mr Nnamdi Nwangwu, said the party was aware that the state had received its share of the federal government’s palliatives.
