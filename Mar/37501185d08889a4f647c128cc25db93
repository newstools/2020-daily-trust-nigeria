Bauchi State House of Assembly has commenced the process to amend its standing orders for effective governance and regulation of its business and proceedings. The move followed a motion by the member representing Dambam/Dagauda/Jalam Constituency, Baballe Abubakar Dambam. The lawmaker explained that the rule book was amended last in 2017 and that there are countless typographical errors and inconsistencies. “Mr Speaker, colleagues, you are all aware that the exercise of legislative powers and responsibilities is regulated by both the constitution and Standing Orders. Therefore, failure to have comprehensive standing orders will not allow the legislative arm to operate at the peak of efficiency,” he said Contributing, Bakoji Aliyu Bobbo (Chiroma Constituency) suggested that since the House has a standing committee on Rules and Business, the matter should be referred to it. He was seconded by Abdulkadir Umar Dewu (Kirfi Constituency). The House adopted the prayers of the motion with amendments and referred the matter to the House Committee on Rules and Business to report back in one month’s time. The speaker, Abubakar Y Suleiman, said the motion was in tandem with the resolution of the Northeast Speaker’s Forum to have uniform standing orders in all the six states assemblies of the region.
