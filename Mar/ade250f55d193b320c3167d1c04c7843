The National President, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Rev Dr. Felix Omobude, has called on leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State to settle their differences and give peace a chance. Dr. Omobude, in statement signed by his media aide, Deacon Ralph Okhiria, described as worrisome the unending crisis rocking the APC in the state. “Politicians should always learn to place the interest of the people and the state above their political and personal goals because power belongs to God and He gives it to the person He wishes. “It’s painful that the two main actors in the ongoing crisis in the APC (Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki), are illustrious sons of the state who have contributed immensely to the development of Edo State,” he said.
