There was however no loss of life as fire fighters from the state fire service, Federal Fire Service and Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) battled to put out the fire. Spokesman of LASEMA, Mr. Nosa Okunbor said the first responders had long been at work since about 02:00a.m. He debunked rumours that the Fire Service responded without water in their appliances.
