The Federal Government has started a nationwide mass registration of businesses in the informal sector of the economy to facilitate the development of a database for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the country. Speaking at the launch of the programme, the Director General of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency (SMEDAN), Dr. Umar Dikko Radda, said the mass registration was expected to facilitate the sourcing, developing, warehousing and managing of a database of small enterprises with a view to providing solution to a formalised MSME sub-sector of the Nigerian economy. He said the registration would help the enterprises gain access to funding support, empowerment, training and other facilities provided by federal government agencies as well as other lending and support institutions at the federal, state and local government levels. Radda said that successfully registered MSMEs would be issued a Digital MSME Certificate, as well as a SMEDAN Unique Identification Number (SUIN). The SMEDAN boss said the programme holds other benefits for MSMEs that include creating higher export potentials, facilitating free matchmaking and marketing through SMEDANâ€™s E-Cloud platforms. He said MSMEs would gain subsidised access to specialised advisory and Business Development Support (BDS) services even as they would be exposed to free mentorship services, participation in government procurement processes, tax holidays and other incentives. Expressing optimism that the registration scheme would also create millions of jobs across the entire country, the DG explained that the justification for a database of grassroots entrepreneurs cannot be over-emphasized, including moving informal enterprises to the formal sector.
