MHUNULG Housing Company, on Wednesday, said it will build 6,290 houses for low-income earners in the 17 Local Government Areas of Plateau State. Comrade Richard Gbawuan, coordinator and chief executive of the company, who disclosed this in Jos, said the initiative followed the realisation that the current realities didn’t favour workers at the grassroots, and to meet the 17 million housing deficit in the country. According to the coordinator, “the company has already engaged with the state government to provide affordable houses for low-income earners who find it difficult to own their houses due to the high cost of building and construction materials.” Gbawuan further said finding solutions to housing needs of this category would not only affect housing delivery positively but also yield national benefits, especially to the local economy by providing jobs, tax revenue, and business income.
