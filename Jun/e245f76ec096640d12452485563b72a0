Chairman of Cross River State Anti-Tax Agency, Bishop Emmah Isong, has hinted of plans by the agency to soon set up mobile courts for the purposes of prosecuting those indulging in collection of illegal taxes in the state. Isong, who disclosed this when he led a delegation of the agency on a visit to the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), lamented that there had been persistent illegal tax collections of assorted rates and levies in the state. He confirmed that the government had already given approval for establishment of the mobile court in principle by the chief judge of the state. He said: “Illegal taxation is killing our people and the governor wept, while setting the agency up to underscore the suffering his people are going through. We need CAN to help us in creating awareness and sensitisation as well as cooperation in terms of anti-tax brigades and marshals that will be engaged.” Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. Responding, the CAN chairman, Amb. Okon Bassey Ekpenyong, said the Christian body would partner with the agency to succeed.
