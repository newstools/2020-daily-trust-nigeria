The Egume Ome Descendants Union has appealed to security agencies and other concerned institutions and individuals in Kogi State to probe the incessant clashes between herders and farmers in Egume community, Dekina local government area of the state. In a petition signed by the Secretary of the Union, Mr Gabriel Ediche and made available to our correspondent in Lokoja yesterday, the group said it was disheartened by the blood bath occasioned by conflict over trespass into farms and farmlands by herders in the area. Daily Trust on Sunday recalls that the vigilante chairman for the community, Mr Attah Isah was recently shot dead in front  his house in Efakwu area by gunmen who reportedly arrived the family compound on motorcycle. Also, a former vigilante chairman in the area, Malam Attah Wada, (Aka) Ukpono was murdered in similar circumstances, while observing his evening prayers in front of his house, while the Amana- Attah of Ojikpadala – Egume, Chief Isah Edime, was also kidnapped from his house and murdered sometimes back. The trios were said to have been at one time or another involved in the mediation efforts over such conflicts before their demise. While commending heads of security agencies, authority of  the Dekina local government area, chiefs and elders for their spirited efforts at ensuring lasting peace between the farmers and the herdsmen in the area, the group called for a holistic look at the remote cause of the misgivings in a view to proffering a lasting solution it. The group noted  that the indigenous farmers and the Fulani herdsmen have co – existed with love, mutual understanding, respect and even inter – married for decades before now, adding that herders had respected boundaries of the land given to them by chiefs and elders in the area and there had never been any case encroachment, nor crisis of the current magnitude.
