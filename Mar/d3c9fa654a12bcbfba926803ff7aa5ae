All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship aspirants in Ijumu local government area of Kogi State, have appealed to Governor Yahaya Bello to respect the existing power rotation among all the three districts that make the area in the forthcoming council poll in the state. Speaking with newsmen on Tuesday in Lokoja, the spokesman of the group and former chairman of the Council, Dr Dada Fehinte Isah said the age long power rotation formula initiated by the founding founders of the area has further united the people and brought uncommon transformation within the three districts. He said the appeal became necessary in view of the rumour making the round that the governor may favour the immediate past chairman, Alhaji Taofiq Isah in the state to emerge as the party’s candidate. He said although they are not against the aspiration of Taofiq, but his emergence would alter the zoning arrangement anchored on fairness and fair play. Dr Isah said as was the case in the past, stakeholders from the three districts should be allowed to decide who the representative should be based on existing formula. “It is pertinent to put on record that our position is not borne out of hatred for the person of Alhaji Taofiq Isah but it is our utmost desire to preserve our age-long system that help us as people so tremendously. “Our renewed attempt to call the attention of the governor is that we are hearing that those to be appointed to be at the helm of affairs in the local government will fly the flag of the party as chairman in the proposed local government election,” he stated. He stressed that Taofiq had served as Ijumu local government council administrator for four good years and therefore the next chairman should come from another zone.
