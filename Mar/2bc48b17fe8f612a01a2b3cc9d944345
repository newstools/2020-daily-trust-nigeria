Daily Trust gathered that on Sunday night, less than 12-hours to the removal of Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, heavily armed security personnel were deployed to the emir’s palace in Kano city. A source at the palace said the former emir was aware of his looming removal. The source said: “We were sitting at the premises of the palace when we noticed movement of some belongings of the emir and when we inquired, we were told that there is the likelihood that the emir will be removed.

He believed that will be the place he will live until he dies,” he said. Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje yesterday approved the appointment of Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero as the new Emir of Kano hours after dethroning Sanusi II. The dethroned emir was reportedly sent to Nasarawa State on exile. Hours after his removal, Sanusi II was flown to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja from where he was driven to Loko in Nasarawa State. A credible source who spoke to him said the former emir was not visibly ruffled despite the situation he found himself. “He was very, very calm,” the source said, adding “I spoke with him…He appeared normal, he told me all is well; he said he has submitted his fate to his Creator.” Sanusi’s lawyer A.B. Mahmud, SAN described the removal of Emir Sanusi as “an illegality.” Ganduje finally removes Sanusi, appoints Bayero as new Kano emir Casualties of Ganduje, Sanusi quarrel Sanusi holds court at Govt House
