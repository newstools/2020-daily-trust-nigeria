The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa State has broken its silence on the sack of its former acting chairman, Alhaji Habibu Sani Sara, saying he was axed over alleged gross misappropriation of the party’s funds when he was in office. The acting chairman of the party, Alhaji Mohammed Umar Dikuma, while chatting with newsmen in Dutse, yesterday, said the action followed an extensive investigation by a committee set up to probe allegations of fraud levelled against Sara. He claimed that the embattled chairman was given a fair hearing and the opportunity to defend himself. However, the embattled chairman faulted the claims, saying due process was not followed in removing him from office.
