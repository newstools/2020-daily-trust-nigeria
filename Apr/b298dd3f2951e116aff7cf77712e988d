A traditional chief in Ilorin Emirate, Magaji Nda of Ilorin, Alhaji Salihu Woru Muhammed has urged the people of Kwara state to observe all the safety measures on COVID-19 saying a similar disease claimed over 85,000 persons live in Ilorin province in 1918. The prominent traditional chief in a statement said there are good lessons people of the state should learn from the 1918 Spanish flu. It said “The Spanish flu hit the whole world suddenly and spread like the coronavirus. It killed about 50 million people across the world. Like coronavirus, there was no cure. The only remedy to the virus was isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants and ban on public gatherings”. It added that over 100-years after, the world has been faced with similar threat from a similar virus. “Again without any cure, nations and leaders are resorting to the same remedies, isolation, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, ban on public gatherings”, he said. The traditional chief in the statement warned that the historical experience invites us to take preventive and control measures against COVID- 19 most seriously. The statement said the gains of adherence to the safety measures far outweigh the current hardship such measures have inflicted on the people. “The truth is that the hard and painful decisions the Kwara state government had taken to prevent and contain the incursion of the virus into our community were forced on the government purely by circumstance beyond its control”, it said.
