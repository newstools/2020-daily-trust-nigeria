Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have shot and killed a man, identified as Samuel at Tika village in Kuje Area Council, Abuja. A resident of the community, Israel Musa, said the incident happened around 9:12 pm on Tuesday, near a stream in the village. He said some women who went in search of water at a pond allegedly ran into the gunmen carrying sophisticated weapons. He said the women, on sighting the gunmen, turned back and ran home to alert the villagers. “When they alerted the villagers some youths mobilised themselves and went after the gunmen at the stream,” he said. He said one of the youths who was carrying a locally made gun shot into the air but the gunmen replied with superior gun power and in the course of  the confrontation, one of the youth was shot and killed on the spot. He said the entire community has been thrown into pandemonium as a result of the incident, saying the remains of the deceased have been deposited at a hospital morgue. Another resident, who also spoke with our reporter, said attacks by bandits on the community had caused panic among residents. “In fact, people are no longer sleeping with their eyes closed as they no longer go to their farms because of fear of attack by bandits,” he said. He, therefore, appealed to the FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, to as a matter of urgency, come to the aid of people of the community by deploying security in the area. The spokesman of the FCT police command, DSP Anjuguri Manza, did not pick calls or reply to a text message sent to him at the time of filling this report.
