Business mogul and politician, Dr Jimoh Ibrahim, has donated N40 million to the Ondo State government as part of efforts to fight the ravaging coronavirus disease. Ibrahim, who presented the cheque to the state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday at the Government House, Alagbaka, Akure, said the state must “as a matter of urgency” declared the Covid-19 problem as a mega project with strategic plans to prevent its spread. He assured Gov Akeredolu of total support from him, while hoping that the people would be fair enough to appreciate the governor’s efforts. Akeredolu expressed his appreciation to Ibrahim for the gesture and assured the people of the state that the money would be spent judiciously on the fight against Covid-19. The governor said that the state had established an isolation centre in the three senatorial districts of the state, adding that the state would also consider Jimoh Ibrahim’s suggestion by involving big private hospitals at the local governments. Explaining why he declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew, Gov Akeredolu said, “We have a problem that there could be community spreading. Some people  prefer beer drinking to their lives. They filled the beer parlours at night and risked spreading potential, and that’s why we declared the curfew.” He said the only way to stop the spread was when the people helped themselves and cooperated with the government on its directive. “There are reasons we take all these actions. We don’t just wake up and issue directives. We are worried about the lives of our people. There is nothing wrong with staying at home for now. We are determined to do our best and work for our dear state,” Akeredolu said. He called on the people to ensure that the protocol established was followed by regularly washing their hands and applying sanitizers.
