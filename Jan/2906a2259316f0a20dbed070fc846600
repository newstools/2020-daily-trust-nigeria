A chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Nasarawa State, Ibrahim Mohammed Hamza has decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP). He was a member of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, (NSHA) representing Lafia Central from 2003 to 2007 under the National Democratic Party, (NDP). Ibrahim Mohammed Hamza said, “I decamped from APGA to because it does not have state spread, which is a defect to any politic party.  I joined the PDP because of its past record in the state, as it has set the foundation for the infrastructural development of the state.” He said that he and about 3,000 of his supporters have decamped from APGA to PDP and not the ruling All Progressive Congress, because it is devoid of development ideals and is not developing the state with the resources at its disposal.
