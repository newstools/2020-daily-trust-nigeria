The Survive Fistula Health Care Foundation (SFHF), a non-governmental organization, has donated food and other items to women living with disabilities in Abuja. The items donated include face masks and hand sanitisers. Speaking during the donation at the Kuje Primary Health Care Centre, Mrs Peters Ogunmayin, Executive Director of the foundation, said the donation was done with support from CBM Australia to enable women with disabilities in Abuja to feed themselves and their families. Peters said the donation was inspired by the challenges the beneficiaries were facing as the country and the rest of the world grapple with the biting effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The support came on a day the United Nations raised alarm that one billion persons living with disabilities across the globe face crises over COVID-19.
