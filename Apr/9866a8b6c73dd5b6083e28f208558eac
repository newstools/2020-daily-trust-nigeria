A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Kano State, Alhaji Muhammadu Abdullahi Sugar, has commended the party’s 2019 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, for disclosing the COVID-19 status of his son. He described the disclosure as an act of patriotism worth emulating. Speaking to newsmen in Kano, Sugar said Atiku has shown the world the kind of gentleman he is by not hiding his son’s status when he was tested and found to be positive for the coronavirus. “It is vividly clear that Atiku Abubakar has distinguished himself to be a very patriotic individual whose concern for his national well-being superseded all other things. “As a true leader, he publicly announced his son’s COVID-19 status and asked Nigerians to pray for him. This is what we expect from our leaders, not the other way round,” Sugar said. He further stated that it is indeed worrisome how other high-level government officials are running away from being tested for the virus, adding that their actions can be seen as a threat to national health security. Sugar then called on all well-meaning Nigerians to emulate Atiku and comply with official health directives toward stopping the spread of the virus in the country.
