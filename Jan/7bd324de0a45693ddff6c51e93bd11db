 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the United States to prevail on President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill. The opposition party equally challenged the US to prevail on the president to do “things that gladden Nigerians’ hearts”, saying the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government has made Nigerians sad. The Deputy National Chairman of PDP, Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, made the call shortly after a closed-door meeting with the US Consul-General to Nigeria, Claire Pierangelo in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Addressing newsmen after the meeting, he said the party leadership told the Pierangelo-led team how democracy had “derailed” under the All Progressives Congress (APC) government. He argued that the judiciary and the electoral system have been compromised under the present administration. He said unless the US monitors and nurtures the democratic system in Nigeria, the next generation may not witness democracy. On her part, Pierangelo explained that the meeting was part of her interaction with leaders of different political parties in the state in order to know their goals and aspirations for the state and Nigeria at large.
