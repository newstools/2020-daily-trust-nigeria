The Federal Government has mapped out 125 aircraft and 13 airports for decontamination across Nigeria. Speaking in Abuja on Wednesday at a briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, the Minister of Environment, Muhammad Mahmood, said this was part of the measures to halt the spread of coronavirus and other diseases. He stated: “Aviation sector is such a specialized sector. We cannot rush things. I did say that we’ve mapped out 125 aircraft and 13 airports. “So far, we’ve decontaminated and disinfected two aircraft. Why we’re not rushing it is because of the nature of the industry. “It’s a place that when it comes to safety, everything must be followed carefully, and even when we want to do that, we have to follow their lead as to how and where to go while decontaminating the aircraft. “For the airports, we need to be led on where we need to go, how and when we need to. The decontamination is ongoing because there are other facilities we’re decontaminating across the country. So, we’ll go as soon as they’re ready for us.”  COVID-19: Funding bailout key to Nigerian airlines’ recovery – Aligbe ‘Etihad, Emirates airlines will soon fly Kano route’ Arik aircraft boss explains collision
