The Senate held a brief plenary on Tuesday and adjourned to Wednesday to honour the demise of Muhammadu Gawo, a lawmaker in the Green Chamber. Until his death, Gawo was a member of the House of Representative, representing Garki/Babura Federal Constituency in Jigawa State. Gawo passed away in Dubai during the Christmas break. The adjournment followed a motion by the Senate Leader, Abdullahi Yahaya, who officially announced Gawo’s death. He asked his colleagues to observe a minute of silence in honour of the lawmaker and moved a motion for the adjournment of legislative activities till Wednesday. Mr Yahaya’s motion was seconded by the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe. The senators after the minute silence adjourned the plenary till Wednesday after a voice vote. Lawan had said on Monday that today’s plenary would be a sober moment for the Red Chamber following the death of the late lawmaker. “So, it is customary that we Honour the late member of the House of Representatives, therefore, the Senate and I believe the House too, will simply suspend all parliamentary activities till Wednesday,” Lawan had said. Meanwhile the House of Representatives also adjourned Plenary to Wednesday to honour the late lawmaker. The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila disclosed that, although Fagen Gawo died over a month ago while they were on recess and has since been buried according Islamic rites, the House as a tradition, will not hold the plenary session.
