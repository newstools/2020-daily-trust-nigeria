A group under the aegis of Concerned Citizens of Kuje Area Council (CCKAC) have threatened to sue the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) over power outage in the area. The leader of the group, Alhaji Yusuf Dabo, while addressing newsmen in Kuje yesterday, said residents of the metropolis especially in  Anguwar Kayarda have been thrown into darkness for over three weeks due to lack of electricity. He said the silence of AEDC officials over the blackout in the area was a serious violation of the contract agreement between the populace and the company (AEDC), which he said prompted the group to threaten court action. According to him, the power outage has crippled socio – economic activities in the area, adding that some sellers of frozen foods have been counting their losses in the area. He added that power outage has also contributed to illnesses, which he said use occasioned by the hot weather. He said hoodlums have also taken advantage of the power outage to break into people’s houses and shops to steal, saying none of the AEDC officials hasbothered to address the residents on the reason behind the power outage. “We will start collecting data across Kuje metropolis after which we shall write and copy the police, AEDC management, SERVICOM and reach out to our lawyers for leaving residents in darkness for three weeks without addressing them” he said. Reacting, the AEDC Public Relations Officer, Mr. Fadipe Oyebode, said it was not true that Anguwar Kayarda has been in darkness for three weeks, saying though there was a technical problem on Friday, officials of the AEDC fixed it. “After the technical problem was fixed on Friday, the light was restored on Saturday but went off four hours later. And as I am speaking to you right now, our men are there working to see that they fix the problem, “ he said.
