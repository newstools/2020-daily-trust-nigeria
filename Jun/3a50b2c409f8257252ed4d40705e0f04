The Bauchi State House of Assembly has adopted a motion calling on the state government to revive indigenous companies and direct all MDAs to buy their products and services as part of steps to boost the stateâ€™s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) and tackle unemployment. The Speaker of the assembly, Abubakar Sulaiman, made the appeal during plenary shortly after a motion was moved by Yusuf Muhammad Bako. Leading debate on the motion, Bako explained that what inspired him to move the motion was the familiarisation visit a committee of the house paid to some indigenous companies in the state: Bauchi Furniture, Bauchi Meat Factory, Bauchi Alind Wire and Cables Limited, Yankari Transport Company, Bauchi Investment Company, Zaranda and Wikki hotels, among others. The lawmaker said Bauchi State had a lot of resources that could generate revenue and create employment but that lack of turnaround maintenance and the inability of the companies to harness such resources for optimal production, were the problems.

The lawmaker urged the house to call on the government to look at the possibility of Public Private-Partnership (PPP) of the indigenous companies and direct all MDAs in the state to patronise their products and services. He also prayed that the government should utilise Bauchi Furniture Company and Alind Wire and Cables Limited to serve as training ground for unemployed youths so as to create job opportunities, settle all outstanding bills for productive and managerial services and purchase new vehicles for Yankari Transport Company or guarantee it loan from any bank.
