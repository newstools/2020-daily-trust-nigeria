An Ekiti State High Court, sitting in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday sentenced a 40-year-old man, Akeem Bakare, to 10 years imprisonment for burglary. Justice Lekan Ogunmoye held that the prosecution had proven the case of burglary preferred against Bakare beyond reasonable doubt. Justice Ogunmoye, who didn’t offer the convict any option of fine, said he was being lenient with the sentence as the accused person was a first-time offender. According to the Ekiti State Director of Public Prosecution, Mr Gbemiga Adaramola, Bakare committed the offence on or about December 31, 2017 at Road 6, Ifesowapo Street and the Better Life area of Ado Ekiti. The prosecution told that court that the accused person unlawfully broke into the house of one Mulikat Arogunmati. To prove his case, Adaramola called four witnesses and tendered exhibits that included a cutlass, a cap, two big stones and the victim’s statement made to the police. Bakare, who was led in evidence by his counsel, Mr Adekunle Ojo, called no witness during the trial. Ojo pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy as his client was committing a criminal offence for the first time.  The convict was first arraigned in court on November 7, 2018 when the charge was read and interpreted to him, but he pleaded not guilty.
