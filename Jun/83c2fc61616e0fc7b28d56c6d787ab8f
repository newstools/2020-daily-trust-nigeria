Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shuaibu joined the PDP on Friday after the governor was disqualified by the screening committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC, from participating in the party’s primary. Obaseki and his predecessor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the suspended national chairman of the APC, have been at loggerheads over the governor’s second term bid and other issues. The feud between Obaseki and Oshiomhole has polarised the party in Edo State. The faction loyal to Oshiomhole endorsed Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu as its consensus candidate for the June 22 governorship primary election of the party.
