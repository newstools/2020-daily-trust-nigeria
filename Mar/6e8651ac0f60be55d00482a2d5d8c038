The PDP ward congress held in Ekiti State has resulted in accusations and counter-accusations from various party leaders in the state. The camps of Senator Biodun Olujimi and former Governor Ayodele Fayose are in a show of strength to control the leadership of the party. Senator Olujimi alleged that members of the committee led by the Deputy Governor of Taraba State, Engr. Haruna Manu, by their actions had compromised to manipulate the process for Fayose’s aspirant. According to Olujimi, the Manu-led congress committee should uphold the result of the congress earlier held, before his late arrival, in Ekiti State. She said the most acceptable and valid results were those duly signed by the INEC officials and security operatives and not the results allegedly concocted by Fayose and his accomplice. But Fayose’s media aide, Lere Olayinka, who denied allegations of writing results of the congress, said “It was those who came from Abuja for the congresses that lodged at a guest house.” Olayinka said Olujimi and his loyalists invaded the lodge of the congress committee with the aim of hijacking the materials which, he said, they could not achieve. He denied that the ex-governor was not at the guest house when they laid siege to the guest house. Fayose, Olujimi, who leads Ekiti PDP?
