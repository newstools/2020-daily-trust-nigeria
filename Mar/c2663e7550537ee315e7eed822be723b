Facebook said Friday it was shutting its London office and part of its Singapore base for “deep cleaning” after an employee in the Asian city state was diagnosed with coronavirus. A staff member working at the US technology giant’s Marina One office in Singapore was on Friday diagnosed with COVID-19, a spokesman told AFP. “We have immediately closed the affected areas for deep cleaning and advised employees based in the affected area to work from home until 13 March,” he said in an emailed statement.
