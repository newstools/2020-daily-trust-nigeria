The Concerned Citizens of Zamfara State has expressed fear that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may lose many members and supporters in the state if Governor Bello Matawalle joins the party. According to the group, the governor would be a political disaster in the party, claiming that he was not qualified to lead the people in any aspect of politics. They were responding to the reported pressure being mounted on the governor by some APC members to join the party. Secretary general of the group, Comrade Musa Gusau, said those mounting pressure on Matawalle were mostly members of his party, PDP. “ Yes, every politician tries to get more people to their party especially governors, but not the likes of Governor  Matawalle who in just 11 months of his leadership, Zamfara State degenerated to a state of coma. “He was massively rejected by the majority of the populace at the poll and the people of the state are always praying for God Almighty to prevent Matawalle from decamping to APC for them to teach him a political lesson in the next election,” they said.
