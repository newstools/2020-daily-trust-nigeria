An Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, chief magistrate court has sentenced a 25-year-old man, Ojo Adams, to three months imprisonment for unlawful possession of some items. Police prosecutor, Inspector Caleb Leranmo, had informed the court that Adams committed the offence on February 9, 2020 at about 10am at the Bisi market area in Ado-Ekiti. Leranmo said a 2000-watt century stabilizer and three sacks containing some other items suspected to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained were found in Adamsâ€™ possession. The prosecutor, furnishing the court with the facts of the case, said the defendant came from Kogi State to Ado-Ekiti with the stabilizer and the other items to sell them. He added that Adams had first gone to Ifaki-Ekiti to sell some of the items and proceeded from there to the popular Bisi market at Ado-Ekiti to sell the rest. The prosecutor said some traders at the market suspected the defendant to be selling stolen goods and immediately reported him to the police, who apprehended him. Leranmo said Adams could not give a plausible explanation on the ownership of the items, which were recovered from him and were tendered as evidence before the court. The chief magistrate, Mr Abdulhamid Lawal, sentenced the defendant, who pleaded guilty, to three months imprisonment but gave him an option of a N10,000 fine. Lawal ordered that the recovered items be kept in court custody until further directive.  2 women docked in Ekiti for alleged fraud, theft Police arraign man over possession of gun in Ekiti Man, 21, sentenced to a year in prison for phone theft
