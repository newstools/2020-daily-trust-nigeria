The FCT Minister, Muhammad Musa Bello, has commissioned erosion control bridge/road improvement works at Ashara in Kwali area council. Bello, while commissioning the project, lauded the efforts of the office of the ecological fund for its  intervention, which he said will control the erosion on the Ashara-Yaba road. He said the FCT administration was quite impressed with the quality of work carried out by the contractor, while urging the council chairmen of Abaji and Kwali to ensure they obtained the necessary permit to enable their business men excavate sand at the river in order to protect the bridge’s embankment. “So I appeal to the chairmen of the two local governments bordering this project to make sure that they get the necessary permit and allow your business men to start collecting sand around this area which will help to protect the embankment,” he said. The minister also urged the chairmen and traditional rulers to ensure the foot of the bridge is clear of any refuse and debris to ensure free flow of water. The permanent secretary, Ecological Fund Office in the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Dr. Habiba Lawal, said the project was initiated through a request for an urgent intervention forwarded to the ecological fund office by the FCT minister, Muhammad Musa Bello. She said the timely completion of the project was made possible through the efforts of the contractor and consultant who worked tirelessly to ensure minimum loss of time in the project implementation schedule.
