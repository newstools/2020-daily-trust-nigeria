A house wife, Maimuna Abdullahi, has urged a Grade 1 Area Court sitting in Gwagwalada, Abuja, to dissolve her one year -old marriage with her husband, Muhammed Muhammed. Maimuna, who resides at Dakwa FCT, petitioned the court to dissolve their marriage because she had a misunderstanding with her husband and after she asked him to divorce her, he left home since December, 2019. She said her husband’s whereabouts were still unknown, and that she has been struggling to feed herself and the only child she had for him. She prayed the court to dissolve their marriage as she can no longer bear it. “We have one child and when we had a misunderstanding, I asked him to divorce me which he refused and suddenly left home since December 2019. I cannot continue to wait for him as I am tired of his attitude,” she said. The respondent was not in court, but his brother, Mr. Wakili Fulani, who stood in for him, told the court that he only stood in as a witness during the marriage of the couple, saying the disappearance of the respondent from home may be as a result of a misunderstanding with the wife. He urged the court to give him some time to enable him speak with the respondent’s mother whom he said may know his whereabouts. The presiding judge, Alhaji Isah Adamu, therefore, adjourned the matter till March 24, 2020, to ascertain the whereabouts of the respondent.  38-yr-old civil servant sues husband over incompatibility Court dissolves 12-year-old marriage over husband’s infidelity Woman seeks end to 16 years of ‘aggressive marriage’
