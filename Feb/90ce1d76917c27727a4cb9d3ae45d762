The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) has prosecuted 95 persons between January and now for environmental offences. Most of the offenders prosecuted were pedestrians who crossed highways, against the Environmental Sanitation Protection Law of 2017. The Corps Marshal of the LAGESC, Akinpelu Gbemisola, said the arrest and prosecution of the offenders followed the step-up of its ‘Operation Zero Tolerance’ to indiscriminate crossing of highways in the state. Gbemisola warned imposters extorting money from the general public in the name of LAGESC to desist from such act. She urged pedestrians to make use of the bridges for free flow of traffic, warning that crossing the highways puts them at risk of getting knocked down by hit-and- run drivers.
