The Association of Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria (ALPSPN), FCT chapter, has donated food items and condiments worth several millions of naira to residents in Garki and other parts of the territory. The ALPSPN FCT chapter chairman, Mr. Lawrence Alobi, who is a former FCT Commissioner of Police, said the distribution of the palliatives was part of the organisation’s contributions to cushion the COVID-19 lockdown effect on residents in the FCT. According to him, there is no gainsaying that Nigerians needed to be specially catered for at this time thus individuals and organisations must continue to support government’s efforts at giving succour to the vulnerable in the society. “We all know that a hungry man is already challenged and the vulnerable Nigerians must be provided for, to at least, be saved from hunger,” Alobi said.
