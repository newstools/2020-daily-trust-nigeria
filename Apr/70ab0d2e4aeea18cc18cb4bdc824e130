The 50-years old doctor, Musa Ibrahim, treated Ambassador Rabi’u at Prime Specialist Clinic.

Since the discovery, Dr Ibrahim has been in self-isolation while awaiting the results of his own test. A copy of the result, obtained by Daily Trust, indicated that the result was released today, Wednesday, April 15, 2020.
