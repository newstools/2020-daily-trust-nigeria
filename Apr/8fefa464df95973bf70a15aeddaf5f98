As countries continue to evacuate their citizens from Nigeria since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, the United States and Canada also evacuated 585 on Monday. While 385 Americans were evacuated, Canada also evacuated 200 of its citizens in the country. They were evacuated in two separate flights operated by Ethiopian Airlines. The Americans were scheduled to be evacuated last Friday before the flight was stalled following issues of over flight permits in some West African countries. The Americans also left Nigeria despite the advisory by the Embassy that they would be responsible for their medical bills because health facilities in the US are currently overstretched due to the COVID-19 battle. The US remains the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus pandemic globally with close to 344,000 cases as at Monday. The United State Embassy in Nigeria said in a statement on its website that evacuees will have to pay the cost of evacuation flights or sign a promissory note to repay the full cost of the seat for a one-way flight to a single destination in the US.
