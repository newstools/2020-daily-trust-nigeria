The Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday charged local government administrators to collaborate more with the state government to deliver democratic dividends to the residents, adding that there must be a synergy between the two arms of government for his administration to achieve its vision of a Greater Lagos. Sanwo-Olu stated this during the swearing-in ceremony of the new Chairman of Ikosi-Isheri Local Council Development Area, Princess Sammy Abolanle Bada, at the Lagos House, Ikeja. The governor said all the infrastructural projects being executed by the current administration fell within the jurisdiction of one local government or the other. He said, “To ensure maximum effect and optimum delivery of dividends of democracy to our people, local governments must strive to complement the state government’s efforts in the areas of construction/maintenance of inner roads, waste management, security of lives and property, primary education/healthcare and so on. We must synergise to deliver a smart city state that works for all.” Sanwo-Olu urged the new Chairman to implement policies and programmes that would have direct positive impact on the lives of the people of Ikosi-Isheri LCDA, noting that as the third tier of government, local government councils were the closest to the citizens and, as such, residents should feel their impact more. Princess Bada, who was inaugurated as Chairman of Ikosi Isheri LCDA following the demise of the former Chairman, Alhaji Abdulfatai Ayodele Oyesanya on Tuesday January 21, 2020, promised to work with the state government to deliver a better Ikosi-Isheri to her people.
