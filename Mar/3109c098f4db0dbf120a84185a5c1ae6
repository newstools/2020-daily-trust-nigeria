The Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has denied allegations of awarding contracts to himself in the assembly as reported by an online news platform. A news platform (name withheld) had in a report published at the weekend accused the speaker of awarding contracts to himself through a company registered in his son’s name. Reacting to the report, Obasa during plenary yesterday described the media outfit as ‘Sahara liars’ and challenged it to provide proof of their assertion to the public to unveil the truth. “What was published by ‘Sahara liars’ has nothing to do with me. I said it two weeks ago when the publication was out about De Kingrun, and I made my position known on that. The fact remains that De Kingrun has no relationship with the Lagos State House of Assembly and I am challenging ‘Sahara liars’ to publish it if there is any; the name of such contracts, the amount, the location, the date and the contractual agreement,” he said. The Clerk of the House, Mr Azeez Sanni, who brought the matter to the House had said earlier that the House did not award any contract to the companies mentioned in the report published by the media outfit.
