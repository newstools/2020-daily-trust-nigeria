It is not clear whether Kogi State Governor Alhaji Yahaya Bello has submitted himself to test to ascertain if he is free of the COVID-19. The governor’s media aides have not responded to our reporter’s inquiries on the development. The governor, who said he was on self-isolation, has since relocated to Abuja but returned to Lokoja, the state capital, on Monday. Bello’s status had been a subject of controversy following his contact with the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari during the 3-day fidda’u prayer of the governor’s mother, Hajiya Hauwawu Bello, in Okene. Kyari is confirmed to have tested positive for coronavirus. Many Nigerians and the main opposition party in the state, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have urged the governor to submit himself to test amidst silence from the government after Kyari’s status was made public. The governor, who was reluctant to speak on the development, had to take to Twitter following online reports alleging that he had tested positive. His Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Muhammed, also debunked the reports, saying his principal was hale and hearty. However, tension further heightened in the state when three governors announced their statuses. This development has made many to call on Bello to submit himself to further test if he had tested negative earlier, as some of his aides said. But up till the time of filing this report, the governor has not said he submitted to test for the virus. Governors Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna) and Seyi Makinde (Oyo) have publicly announced that they have tested positive for the COVID-19.
