The Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has recognized seven companies for conforming to exportable goods standards. The companies include Big Treat Confectioneries, Biz Integrity Ventures, DICON Research Institute, Dorseka Nigeria LTD, Peugeot Automobile Nigeria LTD, Richifa Blocks Industry and Zagi Concrete Industry The Director General, SON, Osita Aboloma, advised producers and manufacturers to ensure they produce quality brands which can drive Nigeria’s income through exports. Aboloma, who was represented by the organisation’s Kaduna State Coordinator, Danlami Datti, said the recognition followed checks of the Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP), worthy of export as a result of their conforming to standards. He explained: “Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) was put in place by this organization (SON) in 2006 to ensure that all locally manufactured producers conform to the relevant Nigerian Industrial Standard (NIS) prior to sales in the market or export. “The scheme is aimed at protecting genuine manufacturers against unhealthy practices such as production of substandard products, faking and counterfeiting as well as unfair competition in trade”, the industry regulator said. In his remarks, Peugeot Automobile Nigeria (PAN) Managing Director, Ibrahim Tanko Mohammed, said the problem in Nigeria is that most consumers do not bother to find out what products are certified or not. He assured that the company will continue to conform to standards it had been certified as part of its business philosophy and continued commitment to customer satisfaction.
