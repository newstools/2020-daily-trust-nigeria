The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has been urged to provide a veritable platform for private and government secondary schools in the Federal Capital Territory to thrive in the area of sports. Founder and proprietress of Gabs Glorious Kids Academy, Lugbe, Mrs Blessing Adeola, who stated this in Abuja during the school’s inter-house sport, also appealed to the government to support them in the area of financing. Adeola, who also allayed fears of parents about the global pandemic, coronavirus, admonished them to take necessary precautions of hygiene to help their wards. “My expectation from government is to create an enabling environment for schools like this to thrive, so that they can be encouraged. One of the areas is to make loans available. “If it is easy for organisations to access funds, they will help government in so many areas particularly in employment. Currently, accessing loan is difficult,” she said. She, however, pledged that the school would abide by all rules set by government authorities in the FCT in carrying out its operations. The pupils participated in various sports activities such as short races, sack races, long and high jump, filling the bottles and choreography among others. Yellow House won the overall best house trophy while winners in different sports activities were given prizes. Cross section of parents who participated in the parents race also admonished government to look into the growing number of out-of-school children.
