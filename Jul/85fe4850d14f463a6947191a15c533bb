A commercial motorcycle rider in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Mr Femi Akinola, has dragged his wife, Alimat, to a customary court seeking a dissolution of their 14-year-old marriage. The marriage is blessed with four children: Ayomide, 12; Akinola Olamide, 8; and three-year-old twins Taiwo and Kehinde. Akinola said he could no longer stay in the marriage with Alimat due to irreconcilable differences, lack of peace of mind and intimidation by the respondent against his second  wife, whom he said had left the matrimonial home because of the development. The petitioner told the court there was no more love between him and Alimat, saying she had once attempted to commit suicide and the court should separate them before she did so. The president of the court, Mrs Olayinka Akomalafe, assisted by Mrs Ogundipe Zenobia and Chief James Jide Aworinde, adjourned the matter till August 27, 2020, saying Alimat should come for her defence on that date with the relevant documents she may need against the petitioner.
