The Police in Zamfara state on Thursday said they have rescued a Nigerien identified as Diddi Kadiri Ibrahim who was abducted in his country but brought to Nigeria by some suspected kidnappers. Briefing newsmen on the development, the spokesman of the state police command, SP Muhammad Shehu, said the Nigerien was a native inhabitant of Abalak community of Tahoua in Niger Republic and was kidnapped there by bandits. “We received information that a white man was kidnapped and seen with some bandits. On account of the information, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Usman Nagogo, directed the police tactical team under the leadership of two Divisional Police Officers from Maradun and Shinkafi local government areas to rescue him. “The two DPOs joined hands with the state Commissioner of Security and Home Affairs, Alhaji Abubakar Dauran, and the kidnapped victim was rescued hale and hearty deep from the forest along Zamfara – Sokoto border,” he said. Also speaking, Alhaji Dauran said the repentant bandits had helped a lot in rescuing the victim. He said he rode on a motorbike for about an hour deep into the forest from one camp to another in search of the victim. “I had to contact Sokoto, Niger, Katsina and Kebbi states to know whether any white man was kidnapped and the answer was negative. Then, we swang into action because initially we thought the victim was kidnapped in Zamfara state. “After rescuing him, we took him to health facility for medical examination and we found him in good health condition. The victim would soon be handed over to his relatives in Niger Republic,” Dauran added.
