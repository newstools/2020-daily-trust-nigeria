The National Association of Nigerian Traditional Medicine Practitioners (NANTMP) has promised to standardise and regulate herbal medicine in Nigeria. President of the association, Dr. Shaba Maikudi, made the a pledge while inaugurating presidential committee on traditional medicine dispensers (hawkers) in Abuja at the weekend. He said an appreciable percentage of the world population is dependent on traditional medicine, noting that it is imperative to set up a task force to create awareness for the public. Shaba added that  the association was committed to ensuring that herbal drugs in Nigeria meet international standard,  stressing that quacks in the sector would be rooted out. “There is a need for integration with dispensers of herbal drugs to ensure compliance of our rules and regulations which is necessary to check quackery. Cooperation is only possible if they are actively involved as our foot soldiers as they can help to create awareness,” he said. The Vice Chairman, Board of Trustees (BOT) of the association, Dr. Yakubu Michika, pointed out that there were plans for the organization to have botanical gardens in the six geopolitical zones in the country but that the funds have not been released by government due to lack of cooperation from traditional medicine practitioners. He also said that a committee has been set up to checkmate illicit practices and dispensing of hazardous herbal drugs with the help of the police to ensure herbal drugs were safe for consumption around the country.
