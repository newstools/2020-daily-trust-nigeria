Detectives attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Lagos State Police Command, yesterday stormed Mafolukun area of Oshodi and arrested a 32-year-old suspected gunrunner, identified as Samuel Uche. The suspect was reportedly arrested while on his way to sell two automatic revolver pistols to a notorious armed robbery/kidnapping gang in the area. It was learnt that the suspected gunrunner had been on the police wanted list for allegedly supplying various armed robbery gangs with arms with which they carried out attacks on innocent members of the public. The Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, who confirmed the arrest during a press conference yesterday, said the “most wanted gunrunner was tracked and arrested based on credible information.” Odumosu said on January 3, at about 9am, information was received from a credible source that some group of people, who dealt on assorted arms and ammunition, were coming to Ajibulu Mafoluku canal area of Oshodi-Lagos to sell arms to a syndicate of armed robbers/kidnappers. He said on receipt of the information, SARS operatives were drafted to the area for close monitoring. According to him, the exercise paid off, as at about 10.30pm, when an average aged man alighted from a motorcycle, close to Oshodi canal. “He was seen with a black nylon bag, suggesting that he could be the suspect. They trailed him and he was eventually arrested. When searched, two English made revolver pistols were recovered from him. “During interrogation, he gave his name as Samuel Uche ‘m’ 32 years old. He confirmed that he brought the pistols to be sold to a gang of armed robbers/kidnappers at the rate of N250,000,” he added. He said investigation into the suspect’s activities was ongoing and that he would be charged to court.
