The Lagos state chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday  commended the state government over what it called “its courageous, inspiring, professional and reassuring response to the coronavirus scourge in the state.” The party in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Seye Oladejo also lauded the social intervention efforts, including the provision of food stimulus package for Lagos residents targeting 200,000 households. But the opposition PDP disagreed with APC, saying the stimulus package and other interventions were mere “propaganda and too hyped”.

The PDP in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Taofiq Gani queried the lockdown in Lagos without commensurate welfare package for the citizens, saying the reliefs being given to the poor and vulnerable were “too hyped and false.
