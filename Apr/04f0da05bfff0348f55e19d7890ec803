FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has urged the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) to supply steady power during the COVID-19 lockdown. Aliyu, who received donations from the management of the company yesterday, said constant power supply would keep residents at home and help in bonding family members. She commended the company for supporting the administration with palliative items, assuring that it is the vulnerable people in rural communities that would benefit. The minister also commended AEDC for connecting the Sample Testing Centres to the national grid, stressing that the move has assisted in having accurate test results. “On behalf of the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, I want to commend the sacrifices made by all stakeholders in this battle against COVID-19. I thank you sincerely, for identifying with us in this difficult period. “Before now, our Sample Collection Centre located at the Central Business District, just behind the International Conference Centre (ICC) was not connected. But when we called upon the AEDC, under 24 hours, there was light. “I want to use this occasion to call on AEDC to ensure that there is constant power supply in other centres so that we can have results that are very correct and accurate,” she added. Earlier, the Managing Director of AEDC, Engr. Ernest Mupwaya, said ‘‘the management of AEDC, has followed with keen interest and a deep sense of appreciation the way the federal government and FCT Administration courageously responded to the fight against the COVID-19 and the provision of palliative items for the residents of the territory’’. Items AEDC donated included 100 bags of 50kg rice, 38 bags of 50kg beans, 60 bags of 10kg semovita and 40 kegs of 25kg palm oil.
