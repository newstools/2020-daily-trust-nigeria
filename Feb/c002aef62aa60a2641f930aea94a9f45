Renewable and self-sustaining mini-grid solutions present a viable solution to achieve universal energy-access goals for remote African communities, the Africa Energy Indaba, has said. The Africa Energy Indaba, the African continent’s definitive energy event, also pointed out that improving energy access for the population of Africa remained critical to achieving the region’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to the industry experts at the event, application of “mini-grids” that operate independently from the main grid in isolated regions of the continent, could also prove sustainable in areas where it remains unfeasible to spread the grid, due to issues of topography or low population density. The Managing Director, Africa Energy Indaba, Liz Hart, said. “Mini-grid power projects are set to make a huge impact as Africa plays catch-up in its generation capacity. These revolutionary solutions will form a key component in the discussions at the upcoming Africa Energy Indaba, and anyone vested in the energy sector will reap the benefits of attending this premier conference. “Our aim is to unlock the potential on mini-grid power projects and catalyse the business opportunity linked to developing these projects in Africa.  The conference programme will feature this aspect as well as link interested parties to the key role-players in Africa”, the industry expert added. 85% of rural dwellers lack  access to electricity –Experts AfDB approves $500,000 grant for clean energy in Nigeria Africa needs N48tr investment to meet electricity access by 2030
