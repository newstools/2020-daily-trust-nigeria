With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of this year, organisations across the planet began to shift into action. But as critical as it was to react appropriately, it has also been important to proactively prepare for the next phase, Lei said in a statement. “At Huawei, we’re aware of the massive effect of the pandemic as well as how seriously communities would be affected.
