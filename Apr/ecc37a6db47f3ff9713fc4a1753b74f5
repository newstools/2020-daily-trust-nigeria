A 59-year-old woman, Victoria Yemisi Omoare, on Wednesday, reportedly slumped and died after alighting from a car to urinate at a place close to the abattoir in Ado-Ekiti, along the Ekiti State University (EKSU). Narrating the incident, Mr Orimaye Oluwafemi, identified as a lecturer in the Faculty of Agricultural Science at EKSU, said he was heading to the university with the woman when the incident occurred. According to Oluwafemi, he was going to the school to fetch some waterleaf in his farm and withdraw some money through the Automatic Teller Machine when the woman, who was staying at his residence and another student opted to follow him. He pointed out that it was when he decided to stop by the road to take a photograph of a particular tree he could use for a thesis he was writing that Omoare decided to use the opportunity to urinate in a nearby bush. However, he added, having waited for her return for about five minutes, he and the student decided to check on the woman, only to discover that she had died. Oluwafemi added that the deceased, a teacher at Adegbola Memorial High School, Akure, Ondo State, was staying with his own family in Ado Ekiti, though he didn’t know any of her family members. He remarked that the unmarried woman just finished her doctorate course and recently complained about abdominal pain two days after she finished fasting for three days. Some medical experts and security officers, who visited the scene of the incident said an autopsy would be carried out on the corpse to ascertain the cause of death. Omoare’s corpse has been taken to the Ekiti State Teaching Hospital’s morgue in Ado Ekiti.
