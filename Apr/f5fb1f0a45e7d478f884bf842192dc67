Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has decried the congestion of corpses in mortuaries in the state, saying they need urgent decongestion. Sanwo-Olu while addressing newsmen in Lagos yesterday said the mortuaries were filled up because of the inability to hold funerals, occasioned by the restriction of movement. He appealed to residents whose loved ones were in the mortuaries to go ahead and schedule their funerals, noting that funeral was on the list of activities exempted from the lockdown restriction. He said the state government would be compelled to hold mass burials for bodies not evacuated from mortuaries in the next two weeks. He re-emphasized that the use of face masks is now compulsory in public places in Lagos State, noting that failure to use masks in public would  sanctions and penalties. Sanwo-Olu said that the State has seen a 76% increase in number of confirmed cases within four days, an average of 70 cases daily. “These numbers demonstrate that we are now firmly in the community transmission phase of this pandemic in Lagos and that our strategy of ramping up testing especially within local communities is working. Also, that this is not the time for us to relax or to slow down in the efforts we are making to break the chain of transmission,” he said.
