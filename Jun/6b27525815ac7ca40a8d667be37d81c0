The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, (FAAN) has increased passengersâ€™ service charge to N2,000 from N1,000 and $100 from $50 for domestic and international passengers respectively. The new charge which may push up air fares ahead of resumption of flights takes effect from August 1, 2020. This followed the approval by the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika. Stakeholders are divided over the propriety of the increment arguing it would lead to passengers paying more for air fare. But FAAN also argued that the old PSC is outdated as it was last reviewed in 2011 while Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited (BASL), operators of Murtala Muhammed Airport Two (MMA2), has been charging N2,500 since.

The increment could affect regional operation more as each passenger would now be made to pay $100 extra in addition to the basic airfare. The proposed increment was communicated to the Airline Operators Committee in a memo which said the implementation was premised on the approval which was sought with the intention to improve airport infrastructure among others.
