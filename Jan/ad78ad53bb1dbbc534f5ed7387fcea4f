The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has warned policemen serving in the state to desist from searching bags, phones and laptops of anyone by the roadside, saying that any policeman indicted for such act would be dealt with. Giving the warning yesterday at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, during the parade of some suspects, Odumosu said, “I did not ask any policeman serving in Lagos to stop passers-by and search their phones and laptops, all in the name of looking for Yahoo boys. Let me warn those policemen who are in the habit of doing so to desist from it or they will be made to face the music squarely when arrested.” The Commissioner, reeling out his plans for 2020, said that the Command intends to fully implement community- based policing policies and strategies that would close the gap between the police and the people and foster a cordial relationship aimed at building strong and effective partnerships. “It also includes visibility policing and prompt response to distress calls, as well as intelligence-led policing approach, professional and unbiased investigation of criminal cases and diligent prosecution. “Others are respect for and protection of human rights and zero tolerance for corruption, cementing multi-agencies collaboration, building capacity for officers and men of the Command and enhancing welfare package,” he added.
