Deputy Minority Leader of Gombe State House of Assembly Rambi Ibrahim Ayala has rejected his suspension by the state executives of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), describing their action as ridiculous. The lawmaker, who represents Billiri East Constituency, was suspended by the state chapter of the PDP for one month over alleged disrespect to the party leadership. He said as a lawmaker, the state executives lacked constitutional power to suspend him, adding that the suspension came up even before the disciplinary committee was constituted by the party. He said the party lacked power to suspend the president, vice president, governor and his deputy as well as members of national and states assembly as enshrined in the PDP constitution. According to him, the party leaders felt aggrieved because of some comments he made during a stakeholders’ meeting at the party secretariat in Gombe, “which they consider to be disrespectful.” APC suspends Gombe assembly minority leader Despite Suspension: Elumelu, Okechukwu, Others to Remain House Minority Leaders Race for NASS Leadership Hots Up
