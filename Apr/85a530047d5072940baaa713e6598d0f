Governors of the 36 states under the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) had on Wednesday agreed on the implementation of an inter-state lockdown in the country for the next two weeks to help check the spread of COVID-19. The governors in a letter addressed to the SGF on Friday also made some recommendations.
