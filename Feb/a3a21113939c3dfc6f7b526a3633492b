The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has issued a two-month ultimatum for illegal dealers of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas, to legalise their businesses or face a total clampdown by the DPR. The Zonal Operations Controller, DPR Abuja, Engr. Buba Abubakar, who gave the warning at the DPR’s Annual General Stakeholders’ Meeting, said the Department had reached an agreement with the LPG retailing group of the Nigerian Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas (NUPENG), on the need to weed out unregistered and unlicensed cooking gas dealers before the crackdown begins. He explained: “We agreed that the LPG retailing association of NUPENG is going to flush out the unregistered retailers among themselves, especially in Abuja. We agreed that they are the ones that are going to do so within these two months. It was agreed that afterwards, the DPR, LPG retailers division of NUPENG and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), would flush out the illegal dealers completely. In fact, the marketers have agreed to assist us in flushing out the unregistered dealers.” Abubakar said the LPG retailers group had asked the DPR two-month grace to sensitise their members on the dangers of not registering and on the dangers of using a green area. According to him, the Department will soon launch an initiative called Minimum Industry Safety Training for Downstream Operators (MISTDO) as part of initiatives to improve the safety of lives and property in the downstream operations. The mandatory training is planned for all operators in the downstream sector, including LPG (cooking gas) and haulage tanker drivers.
