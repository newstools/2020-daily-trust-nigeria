Former president Goodluck Jonathan has said many elections in Africa are not credible because the countries, including Nigeria, are yet to embrace electronic voting system. Jonathan, who is also the United Nations special envoy on crisis management, said it was worrisome that the outcome of elections was not decided by the ballots. He spoke on the presidential panel of the 4th Edition of The Osasu Show Symposium 2020 which was held in Abuja on Wednesday, with theme ‘Rethinking Africa’. According to him, electronic voting is the only way to get credible elections in Nigeria and the rest of Africa, adding that democracy is not practiced where armed thugs are used to thwart the will of the people. “For elections to be democratic, that means that the outcome of the elections must depend on the ballot not any other institution, not even the court.
