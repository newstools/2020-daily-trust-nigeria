An FCT High Court has dismissed a suit filed against the immediate past Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole and three others. Justice Danlami Senchi dismissed the case following an application for withdrawal and ordered the parties to bear their respective costs. The court’s order followed an application by Oluwole Afolabi Esq seeking to withdraw the suit. “The president said no more litigation, that is why we are withdrawing,” he said. Lawyer to Oshiomhole and one other, Ginika Ezeoke Esq, did not oppose the application to withdraw. However, she asked the court to dismiss the suit on the grounds that parties had filed pleadings and joined issues in relation to the subject of the case. Five APC members had sought judicial approval of the suspension of Oshiomhole by Ward 10 in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State, which the court granted on March 4, affirming the suspension of Oshiomhole from acting as National Chairman of APC. The action was filed by Comrade Mustapha Salihu, Anselm Ojezua, Alhaji Sani Gomina, Hon. Fani Wabulari, Evangelist and Princewill Ejogharado. The Court of Appeal on June 16 further upheld the high court order. But Oshiomhole had earlier also withdrawn the appeals he filed in respect of the appellate court’s decision.
