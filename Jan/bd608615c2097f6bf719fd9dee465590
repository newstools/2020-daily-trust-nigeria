President Muhammadu Buhari says underperformance by auditors or ineffective audits contribute largely to governance problem, imploring auditors not to be part of the problem, but the arrow to the solution. Buhari, while declaring open the second edition of the Conference of Auditors-General in Nigeria yesterday, urged auditors to embrace good governance, accountability and transparency. “Through your audit findings and recommendations, corrupt practices would be discovered early and loopholes blocked before they are exploited. “Furthermore, you’ve the full range of audit tools at your disposal including financial compliance, performance and Information Technology audits. ‘‘There is literally no aspect of government performance or expenditure you cannot examine. What may be missing is the will to properly deploy the powers that you have.” Buhari said the 2016 and 2017 annual reports of the Auditor-General of the Federation reflected the reality of corruption, mismanagement and misappropriation facing the nation. He urged the Auditor-General of the Federation to keep all ministries, departments and agencies on their toes through timely and high-quality audits by external auditors. He asked: “Has any annual financial statement produced by any of the states received anything other than a clean audit opinion as far back as you can remember? “You’ll admit this is strange in view of the significant cases of misappropriation uncovered, the huge balances recovered and the sentences being served by convicted officials including past state governors. “One can either assume the audits are not thoroughly done, the auditors have been compromised, or the auditors are constrained in some way or other.” Buhari promises audit institution more independence Auditor-General to President: Absence of Audit Act impeding our work Ocheni harps on financial probity in public sector
