Immediate-past governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, has advised the Nigerian Defence Headquarters to speedily constitute a credible panel to transparently generate facts on how 30 passengers lost their lives on Sunday night in Auno, in the state. Shettima, who represents Borno Central Senatorial District where Auno town is situated in Konduga Local Government Area, gave the advice in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. “In recent days and weeks, there has been growing resurgence of unfortunate attacks by the callous Boko Haram in some parts of Borno State. Of them all, the incident at Auno on Sunday night has been the most dehumanising and disturbing. “As senator representing Borno Central where Auno is situated, I have the option of lobbying my colleagues and sponsoring a motion for the Senate to constitute an investigative panel on the Auno incident which clearly begs for some answers. “However, as someone who knows firsthand the number of soldiers that have given their lives to protect the people of Borno State, I will prefer to concede to another option. “This option is that the Defence Headquarters, which coordinates and supervises all components of the Nigerian military, immediately, constitute a multi-stakeholder panel of credible persons that should speedily gather all the facts relating to the Auno incident,” he said. He said such a panel should constitute representatives from Borno State Government, Auno community, the bereaved families, transport unions, among others. He further charged that the fact finding on the incident should be concluded within days, and should ensure justice and fairness for victims, and also work to prevent future occurrence, particularly by looking into the most acceptable and efficient manner motorists can be managed in the midst of the insurgency.
