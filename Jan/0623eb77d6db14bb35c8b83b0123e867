Following the expiration of the December 31 deadline for implementation of the N30,000 new minimum wage, the Nigeria Labour Congress yesterday asked its councils in the 31 defaulting states to be on standby to robustly engage the state governments on its demands. Only Kebbi, Jigawa, Adamawa, Kaduna and Lagos States have started implementing the new wage. NLC President Ayuba Wabba, in his New Year’s message, reiterated that industrial harmony could not be guaranteed in the defaulting states. He said: “The ongoing revelations on the monumental looting perpetrated by former governors prove that only an intent to loot, and deadened conscience, not availability of resources, would be the reason any governor would hesitate to pay workers the N30,000 new national minimum wage and the consequential adjustment in salaries.” Minimum wage: NLC protests nationwide Minimum wage: Labour urges Bayelsa gov’t to meet Dec 31 dateline 'Govt. has no option than to pay N30,000 minimum wage'
