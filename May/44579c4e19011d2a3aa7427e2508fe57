Because, the continuous omission of the names of Abuja indigenes from ministerial, ambassadorial and other political appointment lists, is a direct incitement of violence from the indigenes against the government, and could be seen as a ‘Time Bomb’ waiting to explode,”he said.”  Abuja natives decry omission from ministerial list We are necessary but not evil, FCT natives reply Buhari Abuja Centenary City: Natives groan over ‘poor’ compensation
