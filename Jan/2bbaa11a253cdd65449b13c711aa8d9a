Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State says he has no anointed candidates for the forthcoming local government election in the state. Our correspondent reports that the Benue State Independent Electoral Commission (BSIEC) in October last year postponed the LGs poll earlier slated for November 30, 2019 to the first quarter of this year. Based on the announcement by the BSIEC chairman, Dr. Joseph Tersoo Loko, during a stakeholders’ forum organised by the commission in Makurdi, some aspirants purportedly paraded themselves as the governor’s anointed candidates for the election into their various councils. Speaking during an expanded caucus meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Makurdi at the weekend, the governor punctured the claims of some of the aspirants, saying he had no favourite candidate. “Let no one tell you ‘I am Ortom’s candidate’ or ‘I am Ortom’s wife candidate’. If I have interest in any local government, I will call stakeholders and tell them. I have no any candidate,” he said. The governor therefore appealed to all party faithful to remain united, stressing that those who had not benefited yet still have more days ahead to reap their labour for the party. “We are happy that the PDP won governor, three senators out of three, eight House of Representatives out of 11, 22 House of Assembly members out of 30 in the 2019 general elections,” he said. Also speaking at the meeting, an ex-governor, Senator Gabriel Suswam, warned anyone parading himself as the governor’s anointed candidate to desist.
