Some students of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, have unveiled some self-made technological products as part of their projects to showcase their talents in the course of their studies. The products, which they showcased to the public last Friday at their project defence, included a drone, a hydro power plant, oxy-acetylene gas welding manifolds and ethanol gas for powering generators. The projects were supervised by lecturers in the school’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and the students explained how they achieved them to the polytechnic community. Omotoso Michael and Ajayi Temitope, defending their scientific innovations, said they were able to achieve the feat through the help of competent and qualified lecturers in their department and promised to utilise the skills beyond the four walls of the schools. Engineer Olorunisola Abayomi, Head of the Engineering Department, Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti, said the students were well trained to compete with their counterparts in the  labour market. Abayomi, called on the federal and state governments to invest in the institution and the students for better breakthroughs in science. The supervisor of the project that produced the hydro power, Engr Kayode Afuye, urged the Ekiti State government to take advantage of the invention to provide electricity for its citizens. The project coordinator, Engr John Momoh, explained that the drone, if properly funded by government, could be used in surveillance to fight insecurity affecting the nation.
