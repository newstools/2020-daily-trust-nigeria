The Nigerian Correctional Service says Maryam Sanda, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging for killing her husband, is still in custody. On January 27, an FCT High Court in Maitama sentenced Sanda to death for killing her husband, Bilyaminu Bello, on November 19, 2017. NCoS spokesman, Chucks Njoku, in a statement yesterday, dismissed social media reports that Sanda was granted presidential pardon last week alongside other inmates of the Medium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje. Njoku said Sanda did not meet any of the requirements and therefore did not benefit from the Presidential Pardon/Clemency. “We further want to assure the public that Maryam Sanda is in our custody and will remain as such,” he added.
