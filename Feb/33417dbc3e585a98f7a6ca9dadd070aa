A businessman, Jonathan Agomuo, has been arraigned in a Wuse Zone 2 Magistrate court over criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and using false truck registration to divert petroleum products worth N20,250,000,00. According the First Information Report read in court, the accused, of Multhal International Limited, conspired and diverted and converted the proceeds of 90,000 litres of AGO meant for the consumption of “Operation Lafia Dole’ valued at N20,250,000,00. City News learnt from the FIR that the said AGO belonged to Alh. Usman Ali of  NAN-NAM Petroleum Company Limited and that  Agomuo allegedly perpetrated the fraud using false truck registration numbers. The prosecutor, S.E Onele, said the offense is punishable under sections 97, 287, 309, 312, 313, 315,and 374 of the penal code cap 81 laws of Northern Nigeria. “Before the court is a fresh information report, we pray that same be read to the satisfaction of the defendant so he can take his plea,” Onele said. The defendant, who understood the content of the FIR read to him pleaded not guilty. The defendant’s counsel, Uzaze E. Ebie, applied orally for bail of his client pending the final determination of the case. He assured that the defendant will not jump bail and will not do anything to prejudice the investigation. The prosecutor objected to the bail application, saying the offence is severe according to section 164 of the penal code law. The Magistrate Njideka Duru, discountenanced the prosecutor’s counsel argument, saying the offense was bailable, and admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of 500,000 with a reasonable and reliable surety who must be a civil servant of not less that level 12 and must be a resident of a definite address within the FCT, must present a copy of his last promotion letter and fill a bond to produce the defendant if need be.
