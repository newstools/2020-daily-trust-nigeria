The Area 1 Command of the Nigeria Customs Service, Port Harcourt, said that it has been given a revenue target of N83,190,666,510.35 billion for the 2020 fiscal year. The Comptroller of Area 1 Command Port Harcourt, Awwal Baba Almed told Daily Trust at the weekend in Port Harcourt that 2020 target for the command surpasses the command’s 47.9b target of 2019 by 35.2bn. Almed said that the command has projected a target of N250m daily so as to realise the N83.1bn revenue for 2020 saying that the command under his watch has put all machineries in motion to meet the target. “The revenue target of the Nigeria customs service varies from year to year. Last year, the revenue target of the area command was N47.9b. The command was able to generate N52.8b surpassing its revenue target with N4.9b” “What the service is expected of us is to achieve the revenue target and the area was able to meet and surpass its target with 4.9bn. This year 2020, the total revenue target for Area 1 is 83.1bn. We are talking of 47.9bn last year and this year we have been given a target of N83.1bn” “So we are expected to generate an average of N250m every day. We are not supposed to apply force in our revenue generation, no, we expected the agents, the importers to have come and bring consignments and make declaration before we can generate the revenue. “I am going to introduce changes to further strengthen the operation here at the Area command. The changes are not far away from what we have on ground but with my coming, I have been able to go round and meet most of the stakeholders”  Onne Customs command targets N140.2bn in 2020 Customs generates N15bn in 3 months in Rivers Export of agro-allied produce from Port-Harcourt now rises to N28.421 billion
