President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday asked the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to work as quickly as possible to break the chain of any community transmission of the novel deadly coronavirus disease. The chairman of the task force and Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, disclosed this in an interview with State House reporters after President Buhari had a video conference with the team. The SGF appealed to Nigerians to be more patient as government adopted measures to contain the virus and ensure their safety. He said: “The President is conscious of the fact that we need to flatten the curve as quickly as possible and be able to trace, find the people, conduct as numerous tests as we can and try as much as possible to break the chain of any community transmission. “I can’t assure you that there won’t be transmission. There will definitely be transmission, but if we are able to get ahead of it, then we can deal with it decisively. “Some of the new measures that the president has introduced, he has asked a committee to look at how the economy will operate within the context of COVID-19 and the other one is for the Presidential Task Force to work hand in hand with the minister of agriculture and the committees on food security and fertilizer to ensure that the adverse effect of COVID-19 on farming is reduced to the barest minimum. “This is because the truth about it is that our people need to go back to their farms so that we are able to raise sufficient food for the people of the country. The strength of the nation is in its ability to feed itself.” How to avoid community transmission of Covid-19 COVID-19: Let’s not lower our guard — Commissioner Kano confirms two more coronavirus cases
