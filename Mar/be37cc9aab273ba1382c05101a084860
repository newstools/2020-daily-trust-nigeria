The Senate has urged registered political parties to make it a policy to give women equal opportunities in all elective and appointive positions. The Red Chamber also advocated gender parity as a priority for women in the amendment of the constitution. This followed a motion on the 2020 International Women’s Day titled ‘I am Generation Equality: Realizing Women’s Rights’. The motion, which was sponsored by Senator Betty Apiafi (PDP – Rivers West) was co-sponsored by eight other female senators in the Ninth Assembly. Senator Apiafi, in her motion, said the International Women’s Day is celebrated on March 8 annually, and is a day set aside to globally celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.
