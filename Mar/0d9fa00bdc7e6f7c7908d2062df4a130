The Ekiti State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Sunday Abutu, who confirmed the development, said witnesses invited the police after the two persons had drowned, adding that policemen thereafter recovered the bodies and took them to the University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti, mortuary. Our correspondent gathered from a source at the scene that two friends, a male and a female who were wtith the deceased, jumped into the Ureje river in their attempt to evade arrest from security agents who had trailed some suspected undesirable elements to the area, which was described as a den of immoral acts. According to the Chairperson, Landlords Association, Bamigboye Community, Deaconess Phebian Fatuase, young men and women often visit the dam area of the river, which she alleged they had turned into a den of criminal activities like smoking of Indian hemp, prostitution and cult initiation. Fatuase added that the community had made many attempts to stop the youths from using the place for their nefarious activities, to no avail. She confirmed that the two persons that drowned jumped into the river on sighting security agents, but died in the process as they could not overcome the volume of the dam water. 2 students drown in Ekiti Ureje river Flood: Ekiti bridges collapsing 2 nabbed for stealing their employerâ€™s car
