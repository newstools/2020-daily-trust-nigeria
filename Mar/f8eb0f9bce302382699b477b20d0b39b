For the first time in 11 years, local government council elections are to hold in Borno State on June 13, 2020. Executive Chairman of the State Independent Electoral Commission, Alhaji Abdu Usman, told newsmen in Maiduguri yesterday that after the 2008 local council election, the exercise had to be suspended due to the Boko Haram insurgency which started in 2009. Alhaji Usman said the election would hold in 5071 polling points in 3933 polling units, adding that the commission’s 312 supervisors and 424 presiding officers would participate in the exercise.
