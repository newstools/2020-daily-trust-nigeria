A London-based Islamic cleric, Saidi Shittu, was on Wednesday charged before the Igbosere chief magistrate court, Lagos, with threat to life. The Police Zone 2 headquarters, Onikan, Lagos, charged 42-year-old Shittu with a two-count criminal charge before Chief Magistrate A. T. Omoyele. The defendant allegedly committed the offence on July 21, 2020 at Lagos Island by threatening the life of Alhaji Olanrewaju Hameed Al-Fulaney and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 56 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. It was also alleged that the defendant on the same date, time and place provoked a breach of the peace through an offensive publication, contrary to Section 57 (c) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State. It was gathered that Al-Fulaney had volunteered to build a mosque but was unable to do so after two years, during which he allegedly collected donations for the mosque project. Shittu was also said to have embarked on a similar mosque project, which he built to an advanced stage within five months. The two men, who reportedly have Facebook accounts, were said to have been using the online platform to battle one another. Shittu was admitted to bail of N100,000, with two sureties. The fourth hearing on the case was fixed for August 26, 2020.
