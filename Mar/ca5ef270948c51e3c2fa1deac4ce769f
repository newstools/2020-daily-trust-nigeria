The Chairman of Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State, Arch. Abubakar Suleiman Gomna, has unveiled plans to increase the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the council to N5 million monthly. Arch. Gomma, who disclosed that before his assumption of office the council was generating N200,000 monthly, said the IGR had increased to N500,000 within a few weeks that he took over as chairman. He said this while speaking with our correspondent in Maikunkele, the headquarters of the local government area, on his achievements in office preparatory to his 100 days in office ceremony. The chairman said: “When we came on board, we barely generated N200,000 monthly as our IGR for the council, but now, we have been able to increase it to N500,000, and we are already making use of our IGR to put some of the dilapidated offices, especially the legislative chamber into shape. We have equally sunk few boreholes with the IGR. “We have drastically improved it (IGR). That is not still our target. We are bringing people who are groomed in the economy on board to see how we can tap from the untapped potentials in the local government so that we will be able to increase the IGR. We don’t have any statutory tax. We only collect the tenement rate from people who do business and revenue from the market”, he added.
