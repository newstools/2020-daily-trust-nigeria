The Senate on Tuesday resumed legislative activities and went into an executive session at 10.50 am after approval of votes and proceedings of last Thursdayâ€™s activities. Though the upper legislative chamber had on its order paper for Tuesday, March 24, presentation of bills, reports and two motions, it is expected to suspend legislative activities due to the coronavirus pandemic. Workers at the National Assembly complex deserted their offices except some senior staff and legislative aides. This is in compliance with federal government stay-at-home directive to workers from level 12 downward.
