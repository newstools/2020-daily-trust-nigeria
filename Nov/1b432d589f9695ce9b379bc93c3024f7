At a press briefing in Lokoja, on Monday, the chairman said the commission will be using all the structures at the disposal of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), except the card reader which the law guiding the commission did not provide for. The chairman said voting shall take place at all designated polling units but warned that loitering in whatever guise at polling stations in the state would not be allowed. All groups, including traditional rulers and the police present at the press briefing, assured the commission that the election would be free from any form of thuggery that had characterised previous elections in the state.
