The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it will review its constitution to accommodate the interest of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), including free nomination and expression of interest forms for them to contest elections. The secretary of the national caretaker committee of the party, Senator John Akpan Udoudehe, said this in Abuja at the conference with APC persons with disability members. The retreat was organised with the support of the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). According to Senator Udoudehe, though the APC-led government has already rolled out programmes that would ensure inclusion, the persons with disabilities deserve more. The former national leader of Persons with Disability of the APC, Misbahu Lawal Didi, said the party has been in government for about six years now, and they have observed some challenges in the constitution with respect to the inclusion of persons with disabilities.
