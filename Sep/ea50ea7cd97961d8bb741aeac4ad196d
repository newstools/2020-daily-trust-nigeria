The Lagos State Signage and Advertising Agency (LASAA) has waived the permit fees for outdoor practitioners spanning from April to June 2020. The waiver, which represents 25 per cent of the outdoor practitioners’ bill for the year, was approved by the state Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The MD/CEO of LASAA, Prince Adedamola Docemo, said the waiver was to serve as a palliative to cushion the adverse impact of the Covid-19 on the operations of outdoor advertising practitioners in the state. Docemo hinted that LASAA will offer a special discount to all outdoor advertising practitioners that are ready to fully offset their 2019 bills. He noted that most advertisers had suspended or cancelled their advertising contracts for the year 2020, a situation that made revenue collection an enormous task for the agency. Docemo said the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic has left many businesses struggling and on the brink of collapse.
