The Gombe State Government has called on the academic staff of state-owned university, Gombe State University (GSU), to embrace dialogue instead of being confrontational in channeling their complaints. The Commissioner for Higher Education, Mr Meshack Audu Lauco, made the call yesterday when the Zonal Coordinator of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Professor Lawan Abubakar, and his team visited the ministry. He said the state government was aware of the many challenges facing the union members at the university, which includes non-payment of earned allowance which accumulated into millions of naira inherited from the last administration. He advised them to shelve the strike they proposed to embark on because Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya has set up a committee under the Deputy Governor to solve some of their grievances. Earlier, the zonal coordinator, Professor Abubakar said they were at the ministryÂ  to present the challenges and grievances of academic staff at the state-owned university. He said they decided to approach the ministry for dialogue and proffer solution to the lingering challenges going on for a long time instead of embarking on a strike.
