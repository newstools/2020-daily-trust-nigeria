The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said its engineers have repaired a 60MVA power transformer while working on another 30MVA transformer at the Sokoto 132/33 kilovolts (KV) power transmission substation in Sokoto State. A statement by the spokesperson of TCN, Ndidi Mbah said the 60MVA transformer became faulty last Wednesday due to feeder currents. By today, the oil filtration will commence towards powering it again. Meanwhile, work is ongoing on the 30MVA transformer in the substation which was shut down by TCN, to take care of transformer oil degradation and leakage. Due to the repairs, TCN said it has been unable to supply bulk electricity from the transformers to Kaduna Electric for distribution to some consumers around Sokoto State. “As soon as the oil filtration is completed, the 60MVA transformer would be energized. Work is on-going to urgently seal the oil leakage problem on the 30MVA transformer,” the statement noted.
