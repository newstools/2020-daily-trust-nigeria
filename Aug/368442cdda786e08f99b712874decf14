Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Niger State, have accused the National Chairman of the party, Chief Uche Secondus and a former governor of the state, Dr Muazu Babangida Aliyu, of fueling the crisis rocking the state chapter of the party. The stakeholders also accused the caretaker committee of the party in the state of partiality and “attempt to impose unpopular, unprepared and rejected’’ aspirant on them. The party chieftains were led by a former deputy governor of the state, Dr Sheu Zabayi Nuhu, to address newsmen in Minna, the Niger State capital on Wednesday. He claimed that the party, in the state was drifting and that Secondus was complicit in the well-orchestrated plan to destroy it. The group, therefore, called on Secondus to stop the congress, saying any further such action would tantamount to an attack on the party he chairs. Reacting, the chairman of the caretaker committee, Alhaji Garba U. Chiza, denied receiving order from any quarter or individual. He, however, said the extension of sales of forms was approved by the national body of the party to allow for wide inclusion of all interested persons especially all those who were early screened out of the exercise. Reacting, former governor Aliyu said the crisis was caused by few individuals within the party, saying he should not be linked with it. Speaking through his media aide, Mr Bala Bitrus, he said the petition that led to the opening up of sales of forms to other members of the party was sent to the national secretariat and not him. Media aide to Secondus, Mr. Ike Abonyi told Daily Trust that there was no crisis is Niger State PDP.
