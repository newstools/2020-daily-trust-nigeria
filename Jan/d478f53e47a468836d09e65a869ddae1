Son of prominent Islamic preacher, Yousuf Deedat, died yesterday after being shot in Durban, South Africa on Wednesday. Police said 65-year-old Yousuf Deedat-son of Sheikh Ahmed Deedat, was shot in the head on Wednesday as he walked towards the Verulam family court on the outskirts of Durban with his wife. An unknown suspect opened fire, wounding Deedat in the head. He was later rushed to a hospital for medical attention, while the suspect fled in a motor vehicle in an unknown direction, Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said. The young Deedat’s son, Raees, said in a statement that his father died at St Anne’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg yesterday afternoon. His family and friends were at his bedside when he passed away peacefully, the statement said. “The family conveys their heartfelt gratitude for the support they received from family, friends and the community. May his soul rest in peace,” it added. The details of the funeral were being finalised. Police said they were still searching for the lone gunman who opened fire on him and fled the scene.
