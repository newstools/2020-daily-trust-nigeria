Five persons abducted by unidentified gunmen in Taraba last week have regained their freedom. Daily Trust gathered that families of the victims paid ransom of N300,000 on each of the five abducted persons. It was further gathered that it took days of negotiation between the kidnappers and families of the victims before they finally agreed on N300,000 on each of the abducted persons. The amount totalling N1.5m was deposited at a location along Sabongida-Sansani road on the instructions of the kidnappers. A source at Sabongida town, Dauda Adamu, said the victims were released shortly after the ransom was deposited and have since reunited with their families. Meanwhile, the Tiv community leader, Zaki Daniel, who was abducted four days ago at Dananacha in Gassol local government of Taraba state is yet to regain his freedom.
