Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni has initiated the construction of fifty-three primary healthcare centers across the 17 local government areas of the state. Already, out of the 53 health centers currently under construction, 23 have reached an advanced stage of completion while 5 have been completed. The Executive Secretary, Yobe State Primary Healthcare Management Board, Dr. Babagana Kundi Machina, who made the disclosure over the weekend in Damaturu, said the projects constitute part of the governor’s pledge at his inauguration to provide a focal health centre to each of the 178 political wards in the state. “The governor has matched the pledge with a strong commitment following the approval of over N4.3 billion to facilitate the construction of the 53 health centres representing phase one of the project,” he said. He said the project work include re-modeling, upgrade of existing wards, laboratories, staff quarters, and outright construction of new health facilities to national minimum standards. He said that when fully completed, the projects would drastically reduce child mortality and morbidity rates within hard-to-reach rural areas of the state.
