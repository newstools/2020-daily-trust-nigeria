Men of the FCT Police Command operating from Wuse Zone 3in Abuja have arrested and arraigned two senior officials of a petrol station in Wuse Zone 1, Abuja. The two suspects, Abdullahi Hassan and Emanuel Joe, manager and supervisor respectively, were arrested over allegation of assault on two security personnel posted to the FCT Joint Task Force on COVID-19. A Wuse Zone 6 Magistrateâ€™s Court where they were arraigned on Tuesday could not sit, hence the Chief Magistrate, Ahmed B. Ndajiwo, granted a remand warrant against them, pending August 18, when the two would be docked. The Prosecutor, ASP Patrick Ejike, told City News that the two security personnel went into the petrol station along with other members of the joint task force, to enforce the use of face mask on some of its pump attendants, and that in the process attempted to arrest one of them, which resulted in a confrontation. The accused persons who were said to be in the office, came down immediately and attempted to prevent the arrest, and in the process, allegedly tore the uniform of a female personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), while the second person, a police inspector, was injured on the finger, it was gathered.
