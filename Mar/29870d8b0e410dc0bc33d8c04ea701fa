A former governor of Bauchi State, Muhammed Abdullahi Abubakar, has prayed for the quick recovery of his successor, Governor Bala Mohammed, Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari and others who have tested positive of the coronavirus disease. Abubakar, in a statement by his Media Aid, Ali M Ali, yesterday expressed shock over the rise in the number of people that have tested positive of the pandemic. The statement reads, “My fervent prayers are with them, their families and indeed others suffering from this debilitating virus. My family and I fervently pray for the quick recovery of these two leaders in particular and other sufferers across the globe. “This pandemic reminds us of the fragility and ephemerality of life; two reasons why we should all close ranks and fight a common enemy that poses as an existential threat to humanity.” COVID-19: 'Bauchi governor's test result to be out in 24 hours' AMVCA7: Ali Nuhu, other Kannywood stars to be tested for coronavirus Niger governor Bello goes on self-isolation
