Four persons yesterday died while four others sustained various degrees of injury when a truck carrying yam crashed at the pipeline junction, Ogere, on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Daily Trust gathered that the accident, which occurred in the early hours of yesterday at about 4.30am, involved a Man Diesel truck with registration number TKP 653 XA. The Public Relations Officer, Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the incident to newsmen in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, yesterday. Akinbiyi stated that the accident involved 14 people, comprising 13 male and one female. Four of the men died, while four other men sustained injuries. “The vehicle was coming from the North in-bound Lagos, loaded with yams. The casualty figure was high because some of the passengers, who were also likely owners of the yam, were sitting on the yam in the open space at the back. “The drive lost control of the vehicle due to excessive speeding and poor visibility and fell on its side, with the yam and vehicle falling on some of the passengers,” he said. The corpses of the deceased, the spokesman added, had been deposited at the FOS mortuary, Ipara, Remo, while the injured were taken to Idera Hospital, Sagamu. Akinbiyi implored drivers to ensure proper maintenance of their vehicles and avoid speeding, especially at night and during the harmattan season when visibility would be poor.
