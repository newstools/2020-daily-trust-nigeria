National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), Borno State Chapter, yesterday flagged off free medical outreaches  to enhance the health of hundreds of displaced persons affected by the Boko Haram insurgency. The State Coordinator of the service, Nura Umar, said during the flagging off of the outreach, that it was organised by the medical corp personnel concerned with the well-being of the IDPs. “Our main focus here is to provide free medical intervention to hundreds of displaced persons staying in this camp.” The Coordinator said the outreach was necessitated by the existence of a gap in the healthcare delivery system to the IDPs, assuring that the NYSC Borno chapter has medical teams that can fill the gap to improve their health. Mr Nura assured that the exercise would go round all the IDP camps within Maiduguri metropolis. “Our intervention is not only medical outreach.  We are discussing with the camp authorities on our intention to open learning classes for the children and skill acquisition centre for the adults here,”Nura said. One the beneficiaries, a mother Falmata Abu, commended the efforts of the corps members for their resilience and service to the IDPs. She also applauded the management of the NYSC for sustaining the scheme and coming up with laudable programmes that are beneficial to the general public.
