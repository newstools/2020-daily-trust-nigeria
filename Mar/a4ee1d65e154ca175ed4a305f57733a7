The Christian Association of Nigeria yesterday called on politicians not to politicise the coronavirus outbreak in the country, saying they should rather join hands to ensure that the disease does not spread. CAN, in a statement by its General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, advocated cooperation and understanding between state and the federal governments. The Christian body also warned Nigerians against self-medication. He said: “CAN calls on the Federal Government and the other tiers government to be pro-active in order to contain it and prevent its spread. On our part, we’ll not cease praying until the disease is chased out of our shores.” He also urged every church to immediately make water, soap and sanitizers available for worshippers before and after services. He said: “We appeal to all Nigerians, irrespective of their religious and political persuasions, to embrace simple rules of hygiene regularly for safety reasons. They should also avoid panicking, avoid crowded places and people who are coughing or sneezing, and covering of mouths and noses with a handkerchief or tissue while sneezing or coughing.” Coronavirus: Nigerians panic as FG issues red alert Coronavirus: States beef up emergency response mechanism Averting coronavirus epidemic in Nigeria
