A member of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) in Osun State, Mr Manpasu Mathias, has invented an automated hand-washing machine as part of efforts to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease.

The corps member, with state code number OS/19B/2222, said he spent two weeks on the project he initiated, but which production was funded by the NYSC. Mathias presented the machine to the NYSC State Coordinator, MrÂ  Ayodele Adewale Adegoke, at the NYSC State Secretariat in Osogbo, to the admiration of NYSC officials and members of the public.
