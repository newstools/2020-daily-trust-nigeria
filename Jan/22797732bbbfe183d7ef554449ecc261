Residents of Akurba, seven kilometers from Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, Saturday staged a protest to register dissatisfaction over poor compensation allegedly paid for their lands. The land was taken by the state government for the ongoing 330 KVA electricity substation project. Most of the protesters who are peasant farmers converged on one of the plots of land displaying slips of bank cheques with the amount of compensation paid. They said that the lands are there only sources of livelihood, but the state collected them. The project is being executed by the federal government with the state government providing the land. The protesters displayed cheques with amount ranging from N8, 000 N50,000 issued by the Nasarawa StateÂ  Ministry of Lands and Urban Development. A spokesperson for the protesters, Mr. Yasir Arafat noted that they were not against the project but the state government should do the needful by ensuring adequate compensation for the real owners of the lands. A community leader in the area, Baba Abubakar Badamasi appealed to Governor Abdullahi Sule to intervene in the matter to ensure justice. Commissioner for Lands and Urban Development, Nasarawa State, Mr. Salihu Alizaga called on the protesting landowners to show understanding with the state government and urged those affected to remain calm and not to take the laws into their hand.
