The Imo State Police Command has advised members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and their supporters not to allow hoodlums to hijack their planned protest over the Supreme court judgment on state governorship election. The command in a statement signed by its spokesman, SP Orlando Ikeokwu, stated that while it is the right of every individual or group to protest about any issue, such protest must be carried out in accordance with provisions of the law as it must not be violent or hijacked by hoodlums and used as a tool for looting, chaos and anarchy. The police also warned that the protest must not be conducted in a manner likely to cause breach of public peace. “The Command in conjunction with all security agencies in the state is determined to protect the lives and property of all and sundry, as such anyone or group that incites, instigates, procures violence or conduct itself in a manner likely to cause breach of peace, will be arrested and made to face the wrath of the law,” the statement said. It also advised members of the public to go about their lawful businesses without fear of molestation as arrangements were in place to ensure safety and security of all.
