The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has reiterated that the ban on street begging is still in effect in the territory and urged relevant agencies to enforce the law. The FCT Security Committee meeting which was chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, made the resolution. Speaking after the meeting, which took place at the official residence of the Minister at Life Camp, Sir Ohaa, said the enforcement of the ban became necessary to curtail the influx of beggars and miscreants to the FCT following the ban on street begging by some states in the country. The permanent secretary said that relevant officers have been directed to intensify public enlightenment campaigns to enforce the ban on street begging, which he noted has negative security implications. “We want to ensure that the FCT does not become a safe haven to beggars that may be coming from other states that have banned street begging,” he said. Also speaking, the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, said there has been a significant improvement in security in the FCT, attributing it to a renewed synergy among security agencies. “There is a lot of synergy between the security agencies and we realised that no agency can do it alone. Therefore, we came together and mapped out strategies that will help nip crime in the bud in the FCT and this has been the basis of our success”. Also speaking, the Ona of Abaji, commended the chairman of Abaji Area Council for the proactive measures he has taken, which have resulted in zero kidnapping in his domain in recent times. He said, unlike what obtained previously, “kidnapping is now a thing of the past in Abaji.”  FCTA donates 5 million naira to 7 families with multiple births Eid-el Fitr: FCTA, police assure residents on security FCTA reiterates ban on commercial ‘coaster’ buses
