The Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) has pledged to support the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) by extending loans to rural farmers. NIRSAL’s Managing Director, Mr. Aliyu Abdulhameed, made the commitment when the President of AFAN, Alhaji Faruk Rabiu Mudi, led a team of the association’s executive on a courtesy visit to the agency’s management in Abuja. Mr. Abdulhameed said NIRSAL’s effort towards supporting farmers was informed by the need to improve their conditions and lift millions of smallholder farmers in the country out of poverty. Noting that most rural farmers were still using crude farming techniques, Abdulhameed assured the commitment of NIRSAL to enhancing their access to credit so that they could adopt more beneficial farm practices. To achieve this, he disclosed that the agency had embarked on a programme of structuring agricultural primary production in Nigeria with the Agro GeoCoops initiative in the field, adding that the formation of Agro GeoCoops had commenced nationwide and was based on the Agro Commodity Ecological Areas (ACEA) that had been identified by NIRSAL and validated by research institutes. He said the initiative which was designed to reach 16,000 Agro GeoCoops, four million hectares and eight million farmers presented an organised setting for finance, market and risk management. The AFAN President, Alhaji Faruk Rabiu Mudi, said, “This is critical because without funds, it is impossible to move Nigerian agriculture to agribusiness; without funds we cannot improve the welfare of farmers who are feeding a nation of 200 million people.” Alhaji Mudi added that, “The fact that NIRSAL has facilitated over N100bn into agriculture is no joke, and we as farmers are very happy and grateful.” NIRSAL opens MFB for SMEs, to extend to 774 LGAs Sokoto rice farmers get early input from NIRSAL NIRSAL, NAIC partner PULA on agric insurance
