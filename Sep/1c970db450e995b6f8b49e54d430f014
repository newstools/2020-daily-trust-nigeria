Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc (IBEDC) has apologised to its customers at Mowe, Ibafo and Magboro areas of Ogun state over the poor supply of electricity. The Chief Operating Officer (COO), Engr. John Ayodele, said the situation is a shared challenge between IBEDC and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). He said the three communities get their supply from Oke-Aro 132KV/33KV transmission substation, and allocation by TCN for that area is 13 megawatts (MW), whereas the communities require about 40MW. Ayodele said because the TCN could not allocate the energy required to serve all the customers at the communities, the only option at this time was to deploy intensive load management, thereby ensuring that customers have equal hours of daily supply.
