The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has advised Nigerians to adequately back up their data to guard against losing their documents and having their passwords compromised. Daily Trust reports that the disruptions being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for people to work from home means that more data will be generated and may not necessarily be backed-up appropriately. The agency stated: “Therefore, as we strive towards the realization of Digital Nigeria in these challenging times, the importance of creating a culture of regular data backup among Nigerians cannot be overemphasized. “Data backup is a mission-critical process that NITDA enjoins all to adopt, either as individuals or organizations. As we celebrate the World Backup Day, we call on all Nigerians to embrace the culture of regularly backing-up their data. “The following basic guides are recommended: ensure that you backup your data frequently and at regular intervals; consider using remote storage for your backups; ensure that the files containing your data backups are encrypted and protected; and use multiple methods and multiple media for your data backups”, it added. Data backup is keeping a clean copy of any important digital content aimed at guaranteeing service availability even when computer crashes, cell phones or tablets are lost, data becomes corrupted or a virus destroys data.
