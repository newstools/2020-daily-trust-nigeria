The immediate past governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, at the weekend, described his successor, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, as a disappointment to the people of the state. Mimiko, who is now the Leader of ZLP, spoke at Ile-Oluji in Ile-Oluji/Okeigbo Local Government Area during the campaign tour of the governorship candidate of his party, Agboola Ajayi. He described his successor’s government as anti-people because of the cancellation of free health and increase in tuition fees paid by tertiary institutions in the state. The governor, while reacting to Dr Mimiko’s comment through the spokesman of Akeredolu/Aiyedatiwa campaign organisation, Olabode Richard, said: “It’s unfortunate that a governor that sacked over 10,000 workers in Ondo State is calling the Akeredolu administration an anti-people government. “It’s on record that Governor Akeredolu since inception in office has not sacked anyone in the state workforce either at the local or state level.”  The immediate past governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, at the weekend, described his successor, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, as a disappointment to the people of the state.
