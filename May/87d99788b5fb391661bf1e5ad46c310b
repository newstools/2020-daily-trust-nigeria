Leadway Assurance Company Limited has announced a giveback for its personal motor comprehensive insurance to policy holders. According to the company, the “give-back” is the equivalent of two weeks premium, to policy holders who were constrained to ground their vehicles in strict compliance of the lockdown order by the Federal Government, in alignment with the World Health Organization’s social distancing recommendations. Commenting on the company’s gesture, the Managing Director, Mr. Tunde Hassan-Odukale, said that “the lockdown has had far reaching effects across the country, challenging both individuals and businesses. People are watching and will remember how businesses treated them during this crisis. “Our decision to provide the “give back” to our loyal comprehensive motor insurance policyholders will go a long way to support customers experiencing unforeseen pressure on their finances at this time. This is another way we are thanking our clients for supporting the FG to flatten the curve by staying at home.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
