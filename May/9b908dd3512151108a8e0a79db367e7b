The Jam’iyyatu Ansariddeen Attijjaniyya (JAA) has urged state governors who are evacuating almajirai to their states of origin to stop what it called “persecution of almajirai.” In a statement signed by the National Secretary of the group, Sayyidi Muhammad AlQasim Yahaya, JAA said the governors were first of all responsible for the deprivations the almajirai had suffered over the years and so did not have the moral right to dehumanise them in the name of fighting COVID-19. The group said while it supported efforts by national and sub-national governments towards the fight against the pandemic, it took exception to the forced evacuation of almajirai. The statement reads in part, “The JAA calls for the immediate stoppage to the persecution of the innocent almajirai, while respecting their fundamental human cum national rights of residency and education anywhere in the country, with all the attendant privileges. We are also urging the concerned state governments to take decent practical measures to integrate the almajiri education into the conventional educational system as a right and not a privilege while paying compensation to the unduly victimised, inconvenienced and harassed teachers and students of the almajiri schools.

JAA further noted that there was an urgent need to review the security response system in the country so as to tackle the menace of kidnapping and banditry; mostly in the northern states.
