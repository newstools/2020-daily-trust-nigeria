The Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jibrin, has asked all aggrieved members not to jump ship as the party’s top echelon is working hard to resolve all issues ahead of 2023 general elections. Some PDP bigwigs including Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara recently defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) alleging injustice in the PDP. But Jibrin in a statement yesterday said the BoT and other organs of the party were making efforts to resolve all the contentious issues and urged members to remain strong and work together.
