Vitafoam Nigeria Plc has rewarded the first three babies born on January 1, 2020 at the Lagos Island maternity hospital with gifts. In a chat with newsmen during the gift presentation at the hospital on Wednesday, the company’s commercial director, Mr Owoade Bamidele Sola, said the gesture was not done for financial gains, but to use the opportunity to felicitate with the parents of the new babies as well as give back to the society. Baby cots were given to the first three babies and the other babies born recently were also given other gifts. Mr Owoade added that hospital beddings, bed sheets, pillows, various products that can be used in the wards by both the children and their mothers were given to the hospital management and staff. The manager noted that the organisation has been celebrating the first three babies consistently for decades. He said: “If we leave everything to the government, then, we will not achieve what we ought to. The little we can do as an organisation, we want to do it so that every other person can emulate it, that way, the society can be a better place for all of us.” Island Maternity delivered 3,500 babies in 2019 — MD Inside the world of UNTH conjoined twins Gov Oyetola’s wife showers gifts on Osun first baby of the year
