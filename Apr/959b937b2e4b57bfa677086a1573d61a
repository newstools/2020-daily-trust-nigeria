Hyundai Motor Company has launched Hyundai C A R E, a warranty extension policy for its vehicles worldwide. The policy aims to support Hyundai customers who may face difficulties in getting vehicle maintenance due to restricted access to service centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, Hyundai C A R E ensures that all Hyundai vehicles with original warranties that expire between March 1st and April 30th 2020 will benefit from a warranty extension of up to three months until 31st May 2020.  The company said all warranties that are originally due to expire in May will also be guaranteed coverage until the end of the month. More than 1.21 million Hyundai vehicles in 175 countries will be eligible for the warranty extension. According to the auto manufacturer’s management, the decision became imperative in view of the global reaction to the outbreak of COVID-19, which has caused many countries to take various precautionary measures that include closing non-essential facilities. With the warranty, the company expects to help address any concerns customers may have about being unable to visit a service center to get vehicle maintenance or warranty repairs during government-imposed lockdowns. Going by the development, the auto manufacturing company’s dealers will contact all affected customers separately in the coming days, with more details about the warranty. Commenting, Hyundai’s Vice President of Middle East and Africa, Bang Sun Jeong, said: “We appreciate that many of our customers may have limited or no access to vehicle servicing during these extraordinary times. “With Hyundai C A R E, we wish to set their minds at ease regarding eligibility for warranty repairs and related services in the coming months. Not only do we care about our customers’ health and safety, we care about the ‘health’ and safety of their vehicles as well”, Jeong added.
