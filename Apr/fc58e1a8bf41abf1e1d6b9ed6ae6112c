The Federal and State Governments have been cautioned against politicising the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) scheme. Foremost anti-corruption group, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA Resource Centre) said governments should stop confusing the three-year old CCT with relief package designed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19  lockdown. HEDA in the statement signed by its Chairman, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju advised the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Umar Farouq,  not to confuse the Conditional Cash Transfer programme launched in 2016 with the palliative measures. The group also called for due process and transparency in the disbursement of local and international donations the FG and States are receiving in the fight against the coronavirus. 25,000 Kwara poor households to get FG conditional cash transfer FG pays N214m to CCT beneficiaries in Bauchi ‘FG committed to cash transfer scheme’
