Factional Chairman of the All Progressives Congress APC in Imo State, Dan Nwafor, has asked the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, to implement the decision of the court on the crisis rocking the state chapter of the party. Nwafor expressed regret that while Oshiomhole is enjoying respite from the court in his recent travails, he had elected to ignore the judgment of the same court asking him to recognise the duly elected executives of the party in Imo state.

In a statement entitled, ‘Now that you have received favour from court,’ Nwafor “We carefully observed from here in Owerri the recent events that played out in our party where your seat as the national chairman was threatened and you eventually emerged victorious because you ran to the courts and they gave you judgment. “Sir the irony is while you are still disobeying valid court judgments in favour of our executive, you relied on the same court to redeem your office in times of crisis which you faced recently.” RELATED: Imo APC chairman warns REC against recognising other faction APC in Imo became factionalised following attempts by former governor Rochas Okorocha to impose a candidate for the party in the 2019 governorship election. A splinter group, APC Restoration Coalition, emerged to challenge Okorocha while the other faction, led by Nwafor supported Okorocha. Nwafor later sued the other faction and obtained an order restraining the national leadership of the party from recognising any other faction other than the one led by him.
