The Court of Appeal in Abuja has ordered a stay of execution on the suspension of the embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole. EDITOR’S PICK: Court approves Giadom as APC acting national chairman A three-member panel of the appellate court presided by Justice Abubakar Dati Yahaya on Monday held that Oshiomhole’s ex parte application for a stay of execution of the ruling of the high court has merit.
