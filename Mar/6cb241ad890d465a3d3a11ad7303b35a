There was tension at Kasuwar Bacci market in Tudun-Wada area of Kaduna South Local Government Area of Kaduna State as the state government issued a three-day quit notice to shop owners yesterday. Daily Trust on Sunday gathered that the notice was pasted on shops at the market early yesterday and shop owners are expected to vacate by Monday. The chairman of the Market Traders Association, Alhaji Haruna Dabai, told Daily Trust on Sunday that there was tension among traders at the market. “We just came to the market this morning only to see the notice pasted around the market, giving us only three days to vacate, which means by Sunday the deadline would expire. We have actually spoken to our lawyer but as you can see the whole thing happened at the weekend. “We are telling our members to be calm as we are trying to see how to resolve the whole thing peacefully,” he said. The notice which was signed by the Director-General Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Authority (KASUPDA), Ismail Umar-Dikko on March 6, said the move became necessary in view of the urban renewal projects being embarked upon by Governor El-Rufai. “Failure to comply with the above directive will leave the authority with no option than to demolish/remove your stall at your expense, according to Section 60 of the Kaduna State Urban and Regional Planning Law of 2018,” the notice said.
