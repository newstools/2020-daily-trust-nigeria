Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila has called on clerics to join politics to make Nigeria a better place. He made the call in Abuja while speaking during the launch of a book titled “Road to the House” written by a member of the lower chamber of the National Assembly, Rev. Francis Waive, (APC, Delta). The speaker, who said he initially wondered how the author would combine religion with the murky waters of politics, added that he realised that the lawmaker was inspired by his passion to serve people. He encouraged those who were afraid of joining politics to learn from the experience of the author who contested against all odds. Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege described the author as a good representative of his constituency with whom he had been synergising to serve and uplift the people. The author, Rev. Waive, in an interview, said the book was written as a contribution to the development of democracy and an encouragement to others to join politics.
