The management of Bolingo Hotel and Towers, Abuja has dispelled insinuations in social media platforms that the facility is being used as one of the COVID-19 pandemic isolation centres, saying the Hotel is not one of such centres in the FCT. In a statement signed by the Hotel’s General Manager, Mr Dennis Enoyi, indicated that the NCDC considered the luxury 350-room hotel as one of its isolation centres but ultimately was not used for this purpose. He stated: “The Hotel has applied the approved new protocols for the safety and comfort of our guests, and will continue to provide the best services to ensure a healthy and pleasant stay.” Enoyi added that the hotel supports the NCDC and the Federal Government in its fight to eliminate COVID 19 from Nigeria as it did, when it gallantly fought and defeated Ebola some years ago.
