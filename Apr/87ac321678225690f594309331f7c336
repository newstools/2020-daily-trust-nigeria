The Federal Government has not issued any fifth generation (5G) mobile telecommunication license in the country, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, has said. Pantami said in a statement yesterday that Nigeria might not roll out 5G soon as his office had yet to issue 5G license to any company. “The National Frequency Management Council (NFMC) of which I am the chairman, has not deliberated on or released any bulk frequency spectrum for the deployment of 5G, no license has been issued for the deployment of 5G in the country,” the minister said. He said the country only did a study trial of the latest technology and Nigeria was yet to adopt it. He said the trial process had been concluded on the study and the reporting process was currently ongoing. Pantami said government would not act on speculations but rather take an informed decision on 5G after due consultations with experts and the public.
