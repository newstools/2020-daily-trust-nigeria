A 19-year-old housemaid, Margaret Ikumu, who allegedly used the image photo of her employer’s daughter to fake her death on Facebook, has apologised to the daughter, Dr Nimechi Ugorji, and her family. Ikumu had faked her death on the social media on the claim she did so to end the financial pressure her mother and uncle were mounting on her. She was said to have connived with some of her friends to perfect the act. She was subsequently arrested after her boss stumbled on the Facebook post.
