The Lagos State Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo, says the state government is not against the online teaching initiative adopted by most private schools. She said this yesterday while reacting to a media report that the state government had warned private school owners against their plan to resume academic activities for third term, 2019/2020 session via online teaching. According to her, the ministry is never against online teaching, rather, it is encouraging schools to set up standard online teaching/learning platforms where children can learn effectively. The commissioner described online teaching and learning as the future and most effective method in the face of the ravaging coronavirus pandemic. “Even after the pandemic, we encourage schools to continue with online classroom because it encourages a lot of skills,” she said. She urged schools to consult extensively with parents and find a win-win solution that would be acceptable to all stakeholders.
