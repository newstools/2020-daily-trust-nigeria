The INEC has created a collation portal for the October 31 by-election in Imo North Senatorial District. Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Prof Francis Ezeonu, told journalists in Owerri on Monday that the commission was ready for the by-election. Ezeonu, who said the commission had improved on its 2019 outing, added that the digital portal would enable people to access the site with a particular code. He said the essence of the innovation was to improve the transparency of the process and provide first-hand information about the collation process. The REC, who said politicians in the country were desperate because politics was “lucrative”, warned that the commission would punish and prosecute its officials and ad hoc staff who engaged in acts that would undermine the electoral process.
