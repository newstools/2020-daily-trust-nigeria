Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has called on the Federal Government, (FG) to publish details of the suppliers and contractors, the procurement rules, including bidding processes, the total budget, and all designated voucher distribution and collection sites for the implementation of the school feeding programme at home. SERAP is also seeking; “information on the number of states to be covered during the COVID-19 crisis, the projected spending per state, details of the mechanisms and logistics that have been put in place to carry out the programme, as well as the role expected to be played by the World Food Programme.” The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disasters Management and Social Development, Ms Sadiya Umar-Farouk had, last Wednesday, announced that the government would start feeding school children in their homes during the COVID-19 crisis, starting from Ogun and Lagos states, and Abuja. In the Freedom of Information (FoI) request dated 9 May, 2020 and sent to Mrs Umar-Farouk, SERAP is asking the government to; “urgently invite the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to monitor the implementation of the programme.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
