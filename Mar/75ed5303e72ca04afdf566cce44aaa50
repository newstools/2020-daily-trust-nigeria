An employee of the Federal Inland Revenue Service, Salihu Umar, yesterday confirmed that he tested positive to the coronavirus. Umar confirmed this in on his twitter handle @Necessary_Cho barely two days after the FIRS authorities denied reports that any of its employees had tested positive to the virus. “I have just tested positive for COVID-19. At the moment, I am still under self-isolation as health personnel make their way to my house for evacuation to Gwagwalada Isolation Centre. My neighbours and employer have been notified accordingly,” he stated. Umar, however, called on the Federal Government to shut down Lagos and Abuja immediately in order to contain the spread. The accountant, who has a BSc and MBA in Agricultural Economics and Business Management respectively, said he was exposed to the virus on an aircraft.
