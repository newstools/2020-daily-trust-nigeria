Supporters of the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole have threatened legal action against the Director-General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Salihu Lukman, over a memo sent to the Chief Bisi Akande-led APC National Reconciliation Committee. The pro-Oshiomhole group, under the aegis of Edo APC Stakeholders, who made their position known in a statement signed by Francis Inegbeneki and Suleiman Bagudu, their chairman and secretary respectively, also accused Lukman of being a member of the Peoples Democratic Party but “masquerading as an associate of APC governors.” They described the memo as a “malicious statement against Oshiomhole”, adding that failure to withdraw it within seven days, the DG risked being dragged to court. The statement partly read: “We find that statement as malicious as it was insulting and we have given the sycophantic DG of the forum seven days to withdraw the offensive statement and apologise to Comrade Oshiomhole or risk a legal action. “Whereas, the entire content of his so-called memo tantamount to arrant nonsense, he has, as a matter of fact, ceased being the DG of the Progressives Governors’ Forum from the day he decided to market his soul to those who were afraid of the on-going reforms in the APC being spearheaded by the Oshiomhole-led NWC.” APC crisis deepens as govs move against Oshiomhole What we discussed at APC national caucus — Oshiomhole Our party worse off under Oshiomhole — APC govs forum DG
