The FCT Elections Petitions Tribunal sitting at the Abuja High Court Jabi,  has upheld the election of the Chairman of Kwali Area Council, Mr. Danladi Chiya, if the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the March 9, 2019 election. Delivering his judgment, chairman of the tribunal, Justice  Samuel Idhirhi, leading a three – man panel, held that the petition against Chiya’s victory at the March 9   and March 23 election by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Mr Daniel Ibrahim, lacked merit. He averred that the issue to be resolved by the tribunal was whether or not the result of the cancelled ward was in accordance with the Electoral Act, 2010 as amended. He further said it was only the presiding officer that had the power to make any alteration to the results. He, therefore, held that the petitioners were unable to prove all allegations beyond reasonable doubt, saying the calculations of votes done by the tribunal did not prove any evidence of overvoting. According to the tribunal, the petitioner failed to  establish that the incumbent chairman was not duly elected by the majority of lawful votes, just as he failed to establish that the election was not conducted in substantial compliance with the electoral act and INEC guidelines. Our reporter learnt that Mr. Daniel Ibrahim, of the People’s Democratic Party ( PDP), had challenged the incumbent chairman, Danladi Chiya, of the APC victory at the March 9, 2019 council election on grounds that the election was marred with irregularities and over voting. Ibrahim, while reacting to the judgement during a telephone interview with our reporter yesterday, said it was miscarriage of justice. He said he will meet with his lawyers to study the judgement before deciding on next step to take while urging his supporters to remain calm and law abiding.
