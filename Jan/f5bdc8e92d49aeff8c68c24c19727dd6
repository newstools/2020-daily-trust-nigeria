The Simba Group, distributors of TVS motorcycles and tricycles in Nigeria, has inaugurated a brand-new showroom and service centre in Kano. The company said in a statement that the Simba TVS Centre, which opened recently at Murtala Mohammad Way, Kano is designed to the highest international standards, and offers customers a one-stop-shop solution for motorcycles / tricycles, accessories, spare parts and service. The Simba TVS centre was officially inaugurated by the Commissioner of Transport, Kano State, Barr. M.A Lawal. Speaking at the event, Mr Rana of Simba Group said, “All automotive customers need the highest standards of buying experience which many passenger cars companies have achieved in Nigeria already. But there has been absence of these experience centers in the Keke and Okada universe, and our chain of showrooms strive to close the gap.” Rana added, “Simba has always been committed to social and economic development, and our motorcycles and tricycles strike at the heart of this philosophy – driving millions of Nigerians to work, to school, to pray and to get on with their daily lives; and in turn, driving the economy. Besides all those employed by us directly, our products generate employment for millions of people in the country – right from the drivers of our motorcycles and tricycles, to the dealers, microfinance partners and fleet owners that make them available, and finally to the tens of thousands of mechanics who provide after-sales-service for them.’’ FG tasks Simba Group to establish factories in Nigeria Simba Group launches new Luminous inverter, rewards Nigerian dealers Sanusi commends Simba’s tricycle
