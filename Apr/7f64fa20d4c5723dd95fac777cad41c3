The first lady of Kaduna State, Hadiza El-Rufai has chastised her son, Bello, for allegedly, in his tweets, threatening to rape the mother of a twitter user. Mrs El-Rufai, who was earlier attacked for taking side with her son on Sunday, apologised, saying that having gone through her son’s tweets chronologically, she had had a conversation with him. She said she would never condone sexual abuse in any shape or form. Daily Trust reports that what started as a political debate when Bello El-Rufai described US President Donald Trump as incompetent over his handling of COVID-19 pandemic later degenerated into personal attacks that included ethnic slurs between Bello and some Twitter handles. Consigliere had alleged that Trump was more competent than President Muhammadu Buhari and Bello’s father, the governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai. Bello fired back at Consigliere, saying, “Tell your mother I’m passing her to my friends tonight. No Igbo sounds please! Tueh”. Mrs El-Rufai, who was tagged in some of the tweets, stated, “All you people talking about @B_ELRUFAI, Don’t @ me. Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind. All is fair in love and war. My belief: Respect everyone, but take no … from anyone. I didn’t see any threats of rape. I would never condone that.” The First Lady later, “When I posted the tweet below, I assumed it was just the usual Twitter gbas-gbos. Having read the tweets chronologically, I have had conversations with Bello. Never ever should sexual abuse be employed as ammunition in public/ private exchanges, no matter the provocation. “I can see how my tweet may have come across, and I apologise to those who were offended by it. I say once again, that I’d never condone sexual abuse in any shape or form.” Despite public outrage, El-rufai's son defends derogatory slurs We’re working on Buhari’s 2019 return - El-Rufai Controversy over Governor Yahaya Bello’s coronavirus status
