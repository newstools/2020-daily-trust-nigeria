The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) yesterday said constituency projects were never gifts or donations to communities from legislators, but projects built by government with public funds. The Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, said this at a town hall meeting in Akure, organised for various stakeholders, tagged: “My Constituency, My Project”. Owasanoye, represented by the Commissioner in charge of Osun, Ekiti and Ondo States, Mr Baba Shuaib, said people’s representatives (legislators) just selected the projects based on closeness to the people. He urged Nigerians to always get involved in projects being sited in their communities and always request audience from their representatives. “We wish to state with emphasis that constituency and other projects are funded by government with public money. “This means that the projects are not gifts or donations to your community by political representatives. “They belong to you as fruits of national resources and government responsibility to the people,” he said.
