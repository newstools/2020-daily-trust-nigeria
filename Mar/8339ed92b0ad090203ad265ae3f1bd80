A group within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, APC Reformers, yesterday described the recently announced reconciliation committee led by a former governor of the state, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala and set up by the national vice chairman of the party, Senator Ajimobi as dead on arrival. The group, which comprises of former political appointees and elected officials during the administration of the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, also said the move was the greatest joke in the ongoing drama within the APC fold in the state. In a communique signed by the deputy coordinator of the group, Hon. Wasiu Olatunbosun Akaejo, the group explained that Ajimobi and virtually every member of the said committee played significant roles in the events leading to the present crisis bedevilling the party in the state. But in a swift reaction, the media aide to the former governor, Bolaji Tunji urged members of the party to see the committee as an opportunity for them and embrace the move by the former governor.
