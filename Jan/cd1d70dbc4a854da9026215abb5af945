The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) on Wednesday slammed the Federal Government for declaring as illegal, the newly inaugurated Southwest Security outfit codenamed “Operation Amotekun.” Speaking in Abeokuta, Ogun State, the Southwest Coordinator of NANS, Kowe Odunayo said the outfit which was out to curb insecurity in the region has come to stay. Odunayo who was flanked by other officials of NANS from the zone, warned the Federal Government against politicising security matter which has to do with lives and properties of the people in Southwest. He, however, implored Governors in the region to stand on their feet and ensure that “this laudable initiative is not allowed to be killed by some enemies of peace.” Odunayo said “Even if we want to play politics with everything, must we do same with our collective and individual security. “As much as we paid attention to the wordings of the statement, we have noticed no other thing other than politics and an attempt to block the west from defending itself against attacks by the north. “With the refusal of the federal government and the northerners, it is clear that the northerners are clearly behind insecurity in this country and we would not accept that in our zone. “We however use this medium to appeal to our Governors to stand on their feet and ensure that this laudable initiative is not allowed to be killed by some enemies of our peace. “As students leaders who are also interested in the security of our students and the zone at large, we are using this medium to express our ready to support in entirety all that ‘Amotekun’ stands for because Amotekun has come to stay,” he said.
