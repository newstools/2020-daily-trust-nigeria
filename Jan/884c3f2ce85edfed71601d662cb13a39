He added, “I have no doubt whatsoever that the new year 2020, shall, by the grace of God, be one of the best years for Nigeria in recent times. My conviction stems from my knowledge of the intense and patriotic work the leadership of our great country, both in the executive and legislative arms of government has already put in to pave the way for a new nation that should work for all Nigerians. “But I am also very conscious of the fact that so much work needs to be done in our collective bid to make Nigeria one of the best places to live on the face of the earth. Making Nigeria great is our collective duty. Let us therefore shun divisiveness and build together in the New Year 2020.” Final whistle for 2010 New Year: Remain dogged, don’t give up, Sani tells Nigerians NEW YEAR MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI
