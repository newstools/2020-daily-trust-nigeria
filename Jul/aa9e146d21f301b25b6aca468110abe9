A member of the House of Representatives, Umar Muda Lawan (APC, Bauchi), has called on members of the National Assembly to shelve their annual recess to face the electoral and constitution amendments. The parliamentarians are expected to proceed on their annual recess by month-end which would last for between eight and 10 weeks. Lawal, who represents Toro Federal Constituency of Bauchi State, said shelving the annual recess would help fast-track the passage of items slated for amendment in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as well as the passage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. According to him, the amendments are very important and suspending the annual recess would afford the National Assembly members more time to work on the electoral and constitutional reforms and see to their passage. “If the National Assembly proceeds and thereafter returns from its proposed annual vacation in September, the distinguished senators and members of the House of Representatives may not have the requisite time to debate and pass the constitutional reforms as well as the Electoral (Amendment) Bill before the 2023 general elections. “Passing the Electoral (Amendment) Bill now will go a long way in curbing the anomalies that preceded the 2019 general elections. “The electoral reform is crucial at this moment as it would not only strengthen the integrity and legitimacy of our electoral process thereby preventing electoral violence, but would also guard and protect the sanctity of Nigeria’s democracy,” he said.
