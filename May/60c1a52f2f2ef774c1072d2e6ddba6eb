A faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State has asked President Muhammadu Buhari, to disregard the smear campaign by political opponents against a governorship aspirant of the party in the state, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The faction, in a letter to the president, claimed that those allegedly behind the ‘false’ stories aimed at tarnishing the image of Ize-Iyamu and National Chairman of the party, Comrade Oshiomhole, were ‘unknown and non-existent’. The letter was jointly signed by a former Chairman of Etsako East Local Government Council, Mr Stanley Odidi; former Chairman, Esan North East Council, Mr Sam Oboh; and a former member, Edo State House of Assembly, Etinosa Ogbeiwi. Some party leaders under the aegis of ‘Concerned Edo State APC Stakeholders’ had written to President Buhari warning against Oshiomhole’s ‘draconian’ leadership style and the possible emergence of Ize-Iyamu as the party’s candidate in the September 19, governorship poll.
