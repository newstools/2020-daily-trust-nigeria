The Health & Human Services Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has warned students against drug misuse as that will destroy their future. The acting director of the secretariat, Malam Musa Abdulraheem, gave the warning during an enlightment campaign at this year’s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking at Government Secondary School, Karu, Abuja, yesterday. The director said the FCTA was committed to addressing issues of drug misuse among the residents, especially students, since it set up the Drug Mis-Use Control Committee (DMCC). He stressed that the committee, which is under the Pharmaceutical Services Dept, is saddled with the responsibility of creating awareness on substance abuse and drug misuse in the public. “Their target audience are the youths because it’s more rampant among them and it’s easier to dissuade them to come off it,” he said. Malam Abdulraheem also said the fight against drug misuse and illicit drug trafficking was not just the responsibility of health professionals but also that of the government as well as communities, families, schools, civil societies and religious organizations. “To our dear students and youths, let me seize this opportunity to advise you on the menace of drug abuse. “It destroys the future of otherwise very important personalities of tomorrow. Focus on your studies so that you can be useful members of your family and responsible members of the society. “As future leaders, avoid anything that will deprive you of realising your dreams, goals and aspirations. As young people, the future of Nigeria is in your hands,” he added.
