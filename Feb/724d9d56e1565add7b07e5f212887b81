The Royal School of Educational Therapy Foundation (RSETF), Abuja, in collaboration with Brain and Spine Surgery Consortium, and SYNLAB Nigeria, will offer free medical checks to residents of the territory especially children with special needs. The exercise according to the organisers  will help in early detection of ailments especially for children with disability like autism, down syndrome and cerebral palsy, among others. Addressing journalists ahead of the event, the founder of Royal School of Education Therapy Foundation, Dr. Badewa Adejugbe-Williams, stated that the event has been scheduled to hold on April 4, 2020 at the Exhibition Pavilion, Garki, Abuja. She said some of Abuja’s best healthcare specialists will be at the fair, urging residents of the territory to seize the opportunity to come out for the free medical services. “The need for all-round medical check-up cannot be over-emphasised. It is important for everybody to know his or her health status from time to time especially this era of strange diseases ravaging the global community,” she said.
