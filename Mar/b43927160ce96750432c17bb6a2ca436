The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has refuted misgivings about tariff charges on vessels berthing in Nigerian ports, saying charges on such vessels remain among the lowest in the West African coast. The General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communications of NPA, Jatto Adams, in a statement, disclosed that while $94,567.63 was being charged currently as tariff per vessel that berthed at the nation’s seaports, similar vessels paid as much as $217,879.07 in Ghana. Adams explained that in May, 2019, Messrs Crown Agents, who were commissioned by NPA with the support of UK Aid, produced the result of an assessment which revealed that it is cheaper to berth general and container vessels in Nigerian ports than it is in Ghana and Togo. The statement reads in part, “Specifically, while it costs $94,567.63 (VAT inclusive) to berth a general cargo vessel with Gross Tonnage (GRT) of 26,770 at 196m and cargo of 14,100 Metric Tonnes (MT) in Nigerian ports for instance, ports in Ghana and Togo charge $217,879.07 and $120, 357.58 (exclusive of VAT) for the same types of cargo respectively. “Similarly, while the authority charges $108, 806.90 (VAT inclusive) on a container vessels with 39,906 GRT, LOA of 261m carrying 172×20 and 139×40 containers, ports in Ghana and Togo charge $117,906.58 and $128,406.94 (exclusive of VAT) respectively. “The authority would also want to reiterate that apart from towage dues, which were reviewed to cover the cost of providing the service in 2015, our tariffs have remained the same since 1993. “This is also despite the erroneous inclusion of Stevedoring charges, which is collected by terminal operators as the authority’s component. Costs like freight rates and terminal handling charges are components outside the purview of the NPA, which has no powers to regulate economic activities at the ports.” The spokesman assured customers and all port users of the authority’s commitment to the ease of doing business policy of the government as part of its sustained effort to enhance the competitiveness of all Nigerian ports.
