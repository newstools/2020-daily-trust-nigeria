In a bid to enhance the condition and atmosphere under which newspaper vendors vends their papers, Daily Trust on Friday, gave mini metal kiosks to vendors in Jos North, Jos South and Jos East  local government areas of Plateau State. Presenting the kiosks to the beneficiaries, Media Trust’s Regional Manager, Florence Oketona said the company deemed it fit to provide the kiosks because “we have noticed vendors suffering during the raining season or when the weather is sunny. They find it difficult to remain at their selling points and it sometimes makes them to close for the business very early. “That is why we decided to come up with the kiosks so as to support and encourage our hardworking vendors within the metropolis and even beyond. We hope that with the provision of these kiosks, our sales will equally improve,” she said. Simple Lucky, state chairman of the distributors, while receiving the kiosks, appreciated the efforts of the company, saying “We have been yearning for this and it has come to reality. We want to assure you our vendors will use it meticulously and we believe that with this development, the paper will sell more.” Daily Trust doles out kiosks to vendors in Plateau Jos to tackle street traders with water spray AEDC launches 24hr Abuja self-service kiosk for customers
