The Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN) has expressed displeasure over constant harassment of its members during the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The national chairman of the association, Samuel Adekola, said this yesterday in Abuja in an interview with Daily Trust on Sunday. He said that in spite of the sacrifices of its members in the national response against the disease, the Federal Government has neither recognised nor included them in interventions. Adekola faulted the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for putting community pharmacists in the same category as supermarkets and chemist owners in its guidelines, stressing that community pharmacists were trained professionals. He said the Federal Government launched the National Drug Distribution Guidelines (NDDG) in 2008 to address the chaotic drug distribution system, but till date, no government has the political will to implement the policy. He said this had left pharmacists with no choice than to get drugs from the open market and suppliers. He said, “The Federal Government has continued to shift the national drug policy, year in, year out. We don’t know when it is going to be implemented . “The consequence of this is that drugs have continued to be in the open market and in the hands of businessmen, people who see drugs as article of trade. That is why it is difficult to control price of drugs in Nigeria.” FG: 25,000 made in Nigeria vehicles ready this year FG approves draft policy for Parks reform Oyetola sends Amotekun bill to Osun Assembly
