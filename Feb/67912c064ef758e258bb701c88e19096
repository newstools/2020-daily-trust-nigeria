Organised Labour in Bayelsa State have called on Governor Douye Diri to make workers welfare his top priority for harmonious working relationship with them. They also pleaded with the governor to offset salaries of workers that were not paid last month. Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the state, Comrade John Ndiomu and his Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) counterpart, Laye Julius, gave the advice in separate interviews with journalists in Yenagoa, yesterday. The union leaders explained that some workers in local governments, teachers in primary and secondary schools, workers in the Rural Development Areas (RDAs), ministries, higher institutions, government parastatals among others, are owed January salary. They also stressed the need for improvement in workers welfare which, they said, would go a long way in strengthening industrial harmony.
