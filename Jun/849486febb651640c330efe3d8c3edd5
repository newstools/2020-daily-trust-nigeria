The forum of former House of Representatives members of the APC, yesterday, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on the National Executive Committee (NEC) to disband the National Working Committee (NWC) and constitute a caretaker toward resolving the crises rocking the party. The ex-lawmakers charged the president and the NEC to, at its meeting slated for today, set up a reconciliation and membership drive committee to mend fences and expand the frontiers of the party to face future elections. These were contained in a letter jointly signed by Hon. Usman Balkore Mohammed, Hon. Chidi Duru and eight others, and forwarded to the president, a copy of which was obtained by Daily Trust. The letter partly read: “The caretaker committee, if appointed, should overhaul, recalibrate and reposition the party to face the challenges of future elections. Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. “The committee members must be all-inclusive and reflective of all interests and tendencies within the party as well as possess the desired competence, experience, impartiality and integrity. “The composition may consist of all former chairmen of national political parties who are now members of the APC, and other accomplished and evidently neutral persons. “The chairman, who may emerge from the South-South zone, must never be seen to be controversial and shall enjoy the goodwill of a wide spectrum of all tendencies.” How reconciliation works in favour of Amosun, Okorocha, others APC crisis deepens as protesters call for sack of NWC APC NWC kicks as Buhari backs anti-Tinubu camp
