Detectives attached to the Ikorodu police station, Lagos, have arrested a suspected leader of the dreaded Aiye cult gang, Segun Ariyo. The police said that Ariyo, alias Sangalo, was one of the “vicious gang leaders” they had declared wanted for their alleged involvement in series of murder in Ikorodu and its environs. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, who confirmed the arrest yesterday, said that the detectives, with the support of community policing volunteers, raided some black spots in the Ikorodu area at about 4pm on Saturday after weeks of covert surveillance and arrested the 27-year-old suspect. “The suspect is a vicious and notorious member of the Aiye confraternity and had been on the police wanted list for serial killings of rival cult members. His gang was responsible for series of armed robbery incidents within Ikorodu and its environs,” he added.
