The trial of a dismissed policeman, Olalekan  Ogunyemi, continued yesterday before Justice Adenike Coker, sitting at a Lagos High Court, Ikeja. Ogunyemi’s trouble started on March 31, 2019 at Onipetesi Estate, Mangoro, Ikeja, Lagos, at about 5pm when he was alleged to have unlawfully killed Kolade Johnson by shooting him with an AK 47 rifle in the stomach. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the one-count criminal that the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) levelled against him. At the resumed hearing of the case yesterday, the investigating police officer (IPO) in charge of the case, from the Lagos State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, Mr Chris Akpomomoh, told the court that Ogunyemi had responded to a call that cultists were gathered at a place. Akpomomoh said the accused person and other members of his team, while armed, got to the scene and arrested a suspect. But in a swift reaction, some of the friends of the arrested cultist mobilized to rescue their colleague. He added that under the charged atmosphere, Ogunyemi fired gunshots into the air to scare away the mob. The witness testified that Force Order 237 allowed policemen to fire their rifles in such a circumstance to scare attackers away. The case has been adjourned till March 5, 2020 for continuation of trial.
