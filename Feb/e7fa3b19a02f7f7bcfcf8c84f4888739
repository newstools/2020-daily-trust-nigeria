A Kogi State High Court sitting in Lokoja has nullified the governorship primaries conducted by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which produced Engr Musa Wada as the standard-bearer of the party. Wada, who was the candidate of the PDP in the November 16, 2019, gubernatorial election in Kogi State, is currently at the tribunal challenging the victory and return of Governor Yahaya Bello as the winner, after coming second in the process. Delivering judgment yesterday on a pre-election matter filed by Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim Idris, challenging the emergence of Wada, the presiding judge, Justice John Olorunfemi held that PDP never had a candidate in the November 16, 2019 governorship poll. In a statement, the state publicity secretary of the party, Prince Bode Ogunmola, urged for calm, saying that the judgment would be tested at a higher court.
