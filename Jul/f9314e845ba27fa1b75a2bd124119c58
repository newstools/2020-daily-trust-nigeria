A new Commissioner of Police, Edward Awolowo Ajogun, has been posted to the Ogun State Police Command as replacement for Kenneth Ebrimson, who is bowing out of the service. Ajogun had once worked as Deputy Commissioner of Police, Operations, in Ogun State before he was promoted and posted to the Police Medical Services, Falomo, Lagos, as the Commissioner in charge of Administration. A statement issued yesterday by the Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said Ajogun has been posted back to the state Command as Commissioner. Ajogun, a graduate of Political Science, joined the Nigeria Police Force as a Cadet Assistant Superintendent of Police in 1988 and had worked in various capacities in many states of the country. Oyeyemi stated that the new Commissioner was a Personal Assistant (PA) to the former Inspector-General of Police, Tafa Balogun, and briefly served as Principal Staff Officer (PSO), Lagos Annex, to a former Inspector-General of Police, Solomon Arase. He described the new Commissioner as “a very brilliant officer, good detective and hardworking officer of high integrity.” Imohimi replaces Makama as Ogun CP Imohimi replaces Makama as Ogun CP Police probe ‘assassination plots’ as Ogun PDP crisis gets messier
