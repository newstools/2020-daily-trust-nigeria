The immediate past member of the House of Representatives for Lokoja/Kogi Federal Constituency at the lower chamber of the National Assembly, Alhaji Abdulkarim Usman Isah (Wambai), has extolled Kogi State governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, describing him as a detribalised and unifying figure in the state. Wambai, in a statement issued in Abuja yesterday by his media aide, Onogwu Martins, said the negative picture some people tend to paint about the governor was actually not the true representation and reflection of whom he really is. He said those who only viewed the governor from afar but failed to objectively study his activities and personality closely, often tended to be misled into arriving at a wrong judgment. “One jinx that Governor Yahaya Bello has broken is by putting aside all forms of tribalism and carrying all the segments of the state along in his government,” he said.
