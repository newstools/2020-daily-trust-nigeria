…wants salaries of politicians slashed  The Nigeria Labour Congress has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle insecurity, saying Nigerians are not safe anywhere in the country. NLC President Ayuba Wabba, at  a press conference in Abuja yesterday, noted that recently and on a sustainable basis, Boko Haram insurgents had been hitting soft and military targets on a scale and regularity “that makes one wonder if the gains of the past have not been reversed or wiped out.” “Nowhere are we safe in the current situation. Two days ago, a very close ally of mine was to take a taxi to the city centre, and in the taxi, he was actually abducted where they had a PoS machine, they collected his ATM card and in the same vehicle, they used the same machine to withdraw every money in his account.” “So, clearly speaking, it is a very dangerous trend and therefore, the issue of insecurity needs to be addressed and all hands must be on deck,” Wabba said. He said while he would not “want to be in the politics” of whether the service chiefs should go or not, “what we demand is that the issue must be addressed. If in the process, they need to go, that is the decision that the president and commander-in-chief needs to take. But we want the issue to be brought to an end.” Wabba also called for a downward review of the salaries of political office holders whom, he said, were being overpaid. He was reacting to the recent announcement of a plan by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission to review salaries of public office holders.a FG’s promise of 22m jobs unkept, as unemployment persists NLC to govs: You must pay N30,000 minimum wage Labour calls for downward review of political office holders’ salaries, allowances
