The Federal Capital Territory Administration has disbursed N2. 5 billion to the six area councils in the FCT and other stakeholders as their share of statutory allocation for the month of September 2020. A statement by Austine Elemue, the Special Assistant to the Minister of State for FCT, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, showed primary school teachers getting N1,268,373,922.70 billion while 15 per cent Pension Funds took N226, 478, 989.57 million; Training Fund gulped N24, 952, 415.53 million and Employee Pension Contribution gulped N107, 849, 405.63 million. “In the past, funds disbursed to area councils were published for transparency and accountability, and I want that tradition to continue so that people will know want we receive and how their money is being expended. “To me, this will greatly douse the tension and suspicion among residents that area councils are getting so much and doing nothing with the funds. Besides, if the federal government can publish a detailed account of monthly allocations to states and local governments across the country, then the FCT Administration should follow that example set by the government at the centre,” Aliyu said in the statement.
