Shareholders of Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc have approved major resolutions authorising the company to change its name, reconstruct its share capital and raise up to $70 million (N27 billion) in new capital as part of significant redirection of the company towards growth and profitability. At the annual general meeting (AGM), shareholders approved the change of the company’s name from  Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc to Japaul Gold and Ventures Plc to reflect its new business focus from the oil and gas servicing sector into natural resource management, specifically mining and exploration of export minerals. Shareholders also approved the reconstruction of all existing ordinary shares of 6.0 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each while also authorising increase in authorised share capital to 60 billion ordinary shares. After the reconstruction, shareholders mandated the board to undertake public offering through combination of any book building and public offer to raise $70 million or its naira equivalent through all possible legitimate means. The net proceeds of the proposed new capital raising will be used to finance the completion of expanded explorations among others. Chairman of Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc, Mr. Paul Jegede, said the changes underscored the company’s commitment and proactive nature in exploring opportunities to bring value to its shareholders. He said the diversification was due to the belief that natural resources are a viable substitute for oil, as necessitated by oil prices which have been nosediving even before the COVID-19 pandemic.
