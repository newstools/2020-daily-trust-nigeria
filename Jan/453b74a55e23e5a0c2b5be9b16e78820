The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has expressed concern over the spate of attacks on people along Damaturu-Maiduguri road. ACF National Publicity Secretary Muhammad Ibrahim Biu in a statement said reports of daily attacks by the Boko Haram insurgents on commuters and villagers on the road linking the two states are disturbing and worrisome, considering that several innocent people were reported to have been kidnapped some killed. He said the implication is that the only main road that links Borno to other parts of the country has been placed under siege by such attacks, adding that the situation has threatened the socio-economic activities in Damaturu and Maiduguri thereby placing the people in a state of fear and despair. The ACF urged the security agencies to do more by not only repelling Boko Haram attacks, but also chase them out of their enclaves. He said, “Furthermore, ACF calls on the Military to sustain constant surveillance along the Damaturu-Mainok-Jakana Auno and other parts of the States in order to secure the road and villages along the axis. “ACF also appeals to the Federal Government to adequately provide equipment and logistics to the troops at the frontline to adequately confront the terrorists. “The efforts of rebuilding the war-ravaged areas can only be done and sustained in a secured environment, hence the need for the Military to be more proactive and employ strategy that will permanently degrade activities of the terrorists.” The forum also called on the communities to cooperate and share intelligence with the security agencies in order to make the fight against Boko Haram terrorists meaningful.
