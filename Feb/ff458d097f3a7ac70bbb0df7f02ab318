The Presidency yesterday said President Muhammadu Buhari never promised to make his assets declaration public. The presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said this in Abuja while countering the position of Bishop Matthew Kukah at the public presentation and launch of “One Step Ahead”, a book by a former chairman of EFCC, Farida Waziri. Kukah, who was the guest speaker at the event, said he had heard people asked that “How is it that the President used Justice Onnoghen’s Asset Declaration form to prove his corruption and proceed to sack him, yet the president himself has not publicly declared his own assets as he promised  during his campaigns?” But Adesina, who reviewed the book, responded: “I remember that I was appointed on May 31, 2015 and when I resumed work on June 1, 2015, in a private meeting with Mr. President, one of the first questions I asked him was ‘this promise about public declaration of asset, when are you redeeming it?’ And then he answered me, ‘can you please show me where that promised was made?’ “We searched everywhere and there was nowhere the president ever said he would do a public declaration. And he told me ‘what does the law require?’ The law requires that you declare your assets. Yet, they keep repeating it that he promised a public declaration.” President Buhari, a promise is a promise All assets already publicly declared Presidency to SERAP: No law mandates Buhari to declare asset publicly
