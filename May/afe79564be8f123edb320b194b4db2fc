An Abuja-based educational and charity organisation, Nurul Yaqeen Islamic Foundation, in collaboration with Muslim women, has donated clothes and food items to 150 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the FCT. Director of the foundation, Imam Yahya Al-Yolawi, while presenting the items at Durumi IDPs camp, on Sunday, said the donation would improve the living conditions of IDPs in the month of Ramadan and during the Sallah celebrations. Al-Yolawi used the occasion to appeal to the conscience of wealthy Nigerians, especially the residents of FCT to extend relief materials to IDPs and other less privilege groups in the territory. The cleric also called on corporate organisations and government to introduce skills acquisition training programme for displaced persons and establish schools for their children and mobile clinic for pregnant and nursing mothers.
