A former governor of Yobe State, Senator Bukar Abba Ibrahim, has expressed satisfaction with the level of development under the present democratic dispensation, saying the country is on a journey to greatness. Senator Ibrahim, while speaking with Daily Trust yesterday in Abuja, said more laws were being made and more ideas were being generated to guarantee good governance in the country. “As a member of the same party with the President Muhammadu Buhari in the APC, I am very happy with what he is doing to reposition Nigeria for greatness and development. “Look at the budget that was just passed; it is a clear sign of Mr President’s readiness to give Nigerians good governance. You will recall that budgets were usually passed in June and sometimes in July, a situation which affected good governance delivery. “Again, the present crops of senators we have are making their contributions towards nation building through debate and legislation that will move the nation forward. One can see that this government means well for the masses. “My advice is that the lawmakers should not look at issues from partisan point of view, rather from patriotism and national interest point of view. The nation is greater than anybody. So, we should strive to make laws for Nigeria not for ANPP, APC or for the PDP or any other group,” Ibrahim said. According to him, most of the bills, either executive, or private members bills should be handled in a way that will promote national building and development. He said that the amendment of the electoral laws had contributed tremendously to improving the elections in the country, adding that the National Assembly should be given credit.
