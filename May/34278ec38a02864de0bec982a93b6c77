Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has advised the management of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) to liaise with security agencies and communities to curb vandalism of its facilities. The governor stated this when he received the team of AEDC led by the Acting General Manager, Nasarawa region, Chris Chime, in Lafia on Tuesday. He said: “It reached a point where I said who is doing the vandalisation, and you hear all kinds of theories. Nobody will go and find a life line and vandalize the cable except the line is not life otherwise many deaths would have been recorded”. The governor said communities interested in having power supply would be more than interested to catch and report vandals even if they are staff of the DisCos if their cooperation is sought, recalling that government has supported the electricity company in repairing its vandalized equipment over the years. In his remarks, the Acting General Manager lamented that assets vandalism had been the bane of improved power supply to the customers, adding that currently over 16 transmission facilities are out of function.
