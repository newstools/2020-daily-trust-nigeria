Violence, vote buying and intimidation marred the governorship election in parts of Ovia South West council areas of Edo state. Despite the heavy security presence at Iguobazuwa ward 2 unit 4, 3, 2 and 1, sporadic gunshots were allegedly fired into the air by some unidentified security personnel in a bid to aid ballot snatching by some suspected thugs. It was learnt voting was temporarily halted  as some youths in the area resisted further attempt of intimidation by the shooters. Voters were seen scampering for safety just as some journalists deployed to the area were harassed. Arrival of military and other security agents at the polling center restore calmness for continuation of voting. Though the excise was relatively peaceful at Iguobazuwa ward 1 unit 1, 2, 3 and 4, vote buying took centre stage. The situation was not different at  Usen ward 7 unit 1, and Okha ward 7 unit 10. The election it was gathered was marred with non-functioning card readers in some polling units.
