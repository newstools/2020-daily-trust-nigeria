The Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday disclosed his administration’s plan to expand the capacity of the state-owned independent power plant (IPP). Sanwo-Olu said his administration would be harnessing private investment to boost the output of the IPP in response to the growing need to sustain his predecessor’s ‘Light-Up Lagos’ project. The governor disclosed this during a facility inspection of the IPP in Alausa, which is being managed on behalf of the government by Alausa Power Limited. “We considered embarking on this facility inspection of the Lagos IPP to see how we will optimise the current usage of the plant early this year, given the growing demand for electricity to power public facilities around. “Knowing the current output of the power plant is necessary for us to decide what kind of investment is required to solve the operational issues and upscale the output. When the IPP was built in 2013, it boosted the capacity of government’s offices in Alausa and helps us in our Light-Up Lagos project. But there is a need for us to expand the services for more coverage,” he said. Saying the current output could no longer meet the demand of the state, Sanwo-Olu said the inspection tour would be followed up with a meeting with partners on the IPP initiative to discuss sustainable growth plan on the output, as more government’s facilities were set to be integrated into the power grid.
