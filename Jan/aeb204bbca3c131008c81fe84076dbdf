The lawmaker representing Ekiti Central Federal Constituency, Omowunmi Ogunlola, has empowered 300 women with cash to start micro businesses. The beneficiaries, drawn from the three local governments in the constituency of Efon, Ijero and Ekiti West, received N20,000 each. The money was distributed yesterday to the women during the maiden edition of the Omowunmi Ogunlola Empowerment Initiative held at the Aramoko Civic Centre, Aramoko, Ekiti State. Ogunlola said the empowerment programme targeted the socio-economic uplift of women and widows in the constituency. The federal legislator said, “The essence of the fund is for the women and widows to start their own businesses. Most of them complain about lack of start-up funds despite how enterprising they are. “With N20,000, most of them can start small scale businesses, sell vegetables, pepper and sell even household items. It is just to complement Governor Kayode Fayemi’s efforts at alleviating poverty at the grassroots.”  Zamfara lawmaker empowers 114 women with tricycles, cash How politicians ‘bribe’ constituents with projects Group empowers 600 women to start business in Nasarawa
