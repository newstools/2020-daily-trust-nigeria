The Federal Government has arrested 697 illegal migrants and seized goods worth N7.350bn since the commencement of the partial closure of land borders. The Nigeria Customs Service, in a statement yesterday by its spokesman, Deputy Comptroller Joseph Attah, said as of March 6, 2020, it had arrested the 697 illegal migrants and recorded the N7.3bn seizures. The goods included 86,602 units of 50kg bags of foreign rice, 1,172 vehicles, 695 fertiliser bags, and 2,997 drums filled with petrol. The others were 16,771 empty petrol containers, 90 engine boats, 68 groundnut oil drums, 26 petrol tankers, 14,604 petrol kegs, 656 motorcycles, 15,089 petrol kegs, and vegetable oil. Customs said the drill codenamed ‘Exercise SWIFT Response’ has continued to yield positive results, saving Nigeria huge resources and enhancing national security. “For instance, the importation of drugs and proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which usually fuel terrorism and other forms of criminality in the country have been considerably curtailed,” it noted. The Office of the National Security Adviser, which is coordinating the Exercise Swift Response, had continued to record large numbers of seizures and arrests from the four sectors of the North-West, North-Central, South-West, and South-South geopolitical zones, it said.
