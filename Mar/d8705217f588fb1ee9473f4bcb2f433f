Keystone Bank Limited is partnering with the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) to provide business consultancy services for Micro, Small and Medium scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in Lagos State in a bid to help small businesses grow. Speaking at the launch of the inaugural annual lecture of LCCI SME Support Centre in Lagos, Helen Nwelle, Group Head of MSME and Value Chain Management of Keystone Bank, commended LCCI on the introduction of the programme and assured the chamber of the bank’s “steady” support. Ms. Nwelle noted that, “Keystone Bank is an SME-centric bank focused on delivering tailored MSME value offerings, and that has continually spurred our involvement in programmes like this. “SMEs are the bedrock of our economy and the LCCI SME Support Centre will provide a platform where SMEs can meet seasoned consultants who will offer advisory services in areas of book keeping, capacity building, branding and digital marketing to enable them to remain competitive in the current business climate.” In a statement, LCCI stated that, “The free clinic is also coming at a time when stakeholders are raising concerns about planned increase in taxes and electricity bills. Therefore, our aim is to ensure that MSMEs get the necessary support through mentorship to stay afloat despite the various challenges. “Partnering Keystone Bank on this project made the job easier because the bank is one of the financial institutions that believe so much in the growth of MSMEs in Nigeria.”  FG tasked on friendly policies to revive investors' confidence, support MSME LCCI calls for concessionary tax rate for SMEs Heritage Bank builds leadership capacity among MSMEs
