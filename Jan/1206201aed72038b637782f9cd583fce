Kaduna Electric has sacked some of its staff in furtherance of the company’s corporate philosophy of  instilling discipline and curbing fraudulent practices among the workforce. The company stated that the affected employees had their appointments terminated for various acts of fraud and gross indiscipline. The affected staff members were served their dismissal letters after they had appeared before the company’s Disciplinary Committee to defend themselves over the allegations proffered against them. The Committee found them in breach of the company’s Conditions of Service rules hence their dismissal. A statement issued by the Head of Corporate Communication, Abdulazeez Abdullah, said the company’s management took the painful decision to let go of the staff in order to send the signal to all staff that such unscrupulous behaviour that tarnishes the company’s reputation is no longer tolerable. The statement urged customers not to collude with any of its employees in perpetrating fraudulent acts and endeavour to report any staff engaged in such for disciplinary action to be taken. The company also confirmed that it had begun a series of Change Management campaigns aimed at re-orientating the staff towards service excellence and warned that officials who failed to key into its new vision will be relieved of their appointment.
