The Initiative for Leadership and Economic Watch in Nigeria (ILEWN) has said the electrification of rural communities is key to achieving the Federal Government’s economic industrialization roadmap. The organization’s Executive Director, Ambassador Agbonkpolor Splendour, said this at a news conference in Abuja yesterday. According to him, the rapid economic growth cannot be achieved holistically if electrification of rural areas in Nigeria is given less priority. The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) under the Federal Ministry of Power is the implementing agency of the Federal Government tasked with electrification of rural and unserved communities and is mandated to promote rural electrification in the country. Splendour urged the Minister Power, Engr. Saleh Mamman, to allow the agency to operate smoothly and discharge its mandate freely to the people. He said that some actions of the minister were capable of slowing down the progress of the agency. He noted that the minister recently deployed a full Director to the agency to occupy a position statutorily reserved for a Deputy Director.
