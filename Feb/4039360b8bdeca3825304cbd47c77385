Delta Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, has described the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Rep Ndudi Elumelu, as a leading light and a role model to upcoming politicians in the country. Okowa, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, to mark the lawmaker’s 55 birthday, described Elumelu as a “courageous leader with sterling accomplishments.” He said the contributions of Elumelu in the legislature, especially in the power sector probe of years ago, have remained remarkable. “As a government, we appreciate your sublime contributions to the growth and development of our country, particularly your role in the development of the power and health sectors when you headed the committees of the House in those sectors from 2007 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015. “We remain proud of your leadership role in the National Assembly and we will continue to make supplications to God to grant you good health and greater years ahead,” he said. Elumelu, who represents Aniocha/Oshimili Federal Constituency in the Green Chamber, was first elected into the House in 2007 and served until 2015 when he joined the governorship race in the state, but was unsuccessful. He was elected to the House again in the 2019 general polls.
