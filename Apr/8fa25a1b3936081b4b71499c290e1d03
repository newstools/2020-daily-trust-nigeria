The Nigerian Medical Association, NMA,  Ebonyi state chapter, has raised alarm that the four available ventilators in the health system of the state are not enough to arrest the deadly coronavirus should it enter the state. Meanwhile the Federal Government has proposed the establishment of a N500 billion Covid-19 Crisis Intervention Fund and has sought its approval from the National Assembly. The doctors further called on the state government to provide and equip more isolation centres  in the existing three senatorial zones of the state. These were contained in a statement signed by Dr. John Egede, the state Chairman and the Secretary, Dr. Nwoye Chukwuemeka. According to them  “The effort of the state government is commendable but we continue to remind them that it’s important that the isolation centre is well equipped and made functional before the disease enters Ebonyi state. “Also, the four ventilators are not enough for the state if this [epidemic] meets us. “Again, provision should be made to possibly expand the isolation centres, equip them including having new ones in at least each senatorial zone of the state. “This is because the disease is closer to us than we ever imagined and we should not wait till it enters before taking drastic measures,” the the statement reads. The Ebonyi state NMA also called on the state government to fix it’s existing 13 general hospitals which were under renovation since 2014 and employ more health workers into the system. “This is the time to fix our general hospitals, this fight against COVID-19, should not be left to the Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital alone.” “This is the time to coordinate and get the general hospitals as well as private practitioners involved”, the group explained.
