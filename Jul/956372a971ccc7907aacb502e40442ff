A member of the APC caretaker committee, Senator Yusuf A. Yusuf  has said that a former speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, would play a crucial role in the party’s effort to reconcile aggrieved members. Yusuf told newsmen that  the return of Dogara to the party was a great relief considering his influence as one of the founding fathers. He said, “Dogara took a wrong step in the first place. He was one of the most trusted members of our party. “He was misguided to have left the APC at a very wrong time. We are happy that he is back to the house that he built alongside other leaders.” Reps struggle to settle rift over committee chairmanships Dogara, Gbajabiamila groups’ feud lingers ‘How, why Dogara emerged as Speaker’
