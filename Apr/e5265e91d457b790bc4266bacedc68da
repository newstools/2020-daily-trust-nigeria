FCT Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has promised that the administration will give award the area council which distributes palliatives in the most transparent and accountable manner to vulnerable people. The minister, who made the promise during an inspection of palliative items designated for Abuja Municipal Area Council, (AMAC), also observed that with the difficulties experienced during the exercise, there was urgent need to revisit urban renewal for adequate data gathering and planning. Aliyu, who commended stakeholders for making the exercise a success, however, called on the leadership of the Abuja Municipal Area Council and the monitoring team to be transparent in the discharge of their functions and with the fear of God. A statement by her media aide, Mr. Austine Elemue, quoted the minister as saying, “I have observed something which is quite unique. The traditional rulers from different tribes are being carried along. Seeing the traditional rulers from different tribes to support us is quite encouraging. “The Abuja Municipal Area Council is one cosmopolitan area in which justice must be served. The AMAC houses, all the international communities and I will not expect less from you, rather, I am expecting that after this exercise, and beyond, the award winners of the palliatives distribution will emerge from this area council.” She urged the council authorities to move out of their comfort zone and go into the nooks and crannies to look for people and serve them, stressing that the people must be made to obey the template and comply with social distancing protocols.
