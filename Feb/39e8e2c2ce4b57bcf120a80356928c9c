The Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has disclosed that the Federal Government will empower 20 million Nigerians through non-oil export industrial programmes. Speaking at a stakeholders’ engagement for the implementation of the Youth Export Development Programme (YEXDEP) held in Abuja, the Director General of the NEPC, Olusegun Awolowo, said the Federal Government’s Zero-Oil Plan would lift 20 million Nigerians out of poverty. He said the deliberate government policy was aimed at creating 500, 000 additional jobs annually. Awolowo said the jobs created would help Nigeria achieve the Goal 8 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which hinges on creating “decent work and economic growth.” The NEPC boss told the stakeholders that the Zero-Oil Plan would contribute to SDG one, which hinges on “no poverty.” “Nigeria’s comparative advantage is our youth, and it is time we realise this as a nation,” he said.
