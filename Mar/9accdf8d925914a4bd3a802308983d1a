The accused was said to have committed the offence contrary to section 8(a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006 and punishable under section 1(3) of the same Act‚Äù. However, the defendant, pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to him. Prosecution counsel, Mary Onoja, asked for a trial date and for the defendant to be remanded in custody pending his bail. But, the counsel to the defendant, H. M. Animasun prayed the court to allow him make an oral application for the bail of his client which was rejected by the court. The court held that he should file a proper application for bail. Justice Olajuwon therefore remanded the defendant in Makurdi Correctional Centre pending the hearing of his bail application. The case has been adjourned to May 11, 2020 for commencement of trial.
