The new Director, Human Resource Management (HRM) of the Federal Capital Territory Administration, Bashir Mohammemad, has resumed duties with a promise to improve discipline in the system. Mohammad who promised to build on the successes of his predecessor, said he will lead by example so as to inspire discipline. “I am going to build on the successes of my predecessor, there will be constant meetings with relevant directors to assess issues that will add value to FCT Administration.” “No one is going to be spared, I can’t come here 12 noon and expect my subordinates to come by 8:00am. I can’t leave here before 4:00 pm and expect the staff to be in the office till 4:00pm, charity begins at home” he said. He said without discipline in an administrative setting there would not be meaningful output. According to him, quality leadership in an organisation brings about better results and must not be compromised in FCT. “Discipline in the society is the key thing that must be strictly adhered to, especially by being firm and fair to all,” he said. Mohammad until his new position was the Director, FCT Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board. He joined the services of FCTA in 1989 as a personnel officer II (Training) with FCDA.
