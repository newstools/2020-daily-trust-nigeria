The senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, Comrade Abba Moro, at the weekend condemned the physical assault on his Special Assistant on Print and Electronic Media, Ameh Godwin, by alleged political thugs. Godwin was allegedly beaten up by some political thugs suspected to be loyal to a chairmanship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming local government election in the state over a minor perceived disagreement. But Senator Moro, in a statement issued by his senior legislative aide, Emmanuel Eche-Ofun, noted that thuggery has remained an anathema to the culture of good governance and ways of life and must be discouraged.
