TAJBank, Nigeria’s most innovative non-interest financial institution has launched TAJXPRESS, a full service financial inclusion suite, as part of its drive to significantly boost financial inclusion in the country. The financial inclusion suite includes a digital wallet, *898# USSD, 360 degree account on-boarding through mobile and internet banking platforms in addition to 10,000 agents spread across the North East and North West of Nigeria. Reiterating the bank’s commitment to boost financial inclusion in the country, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of TAJBank, Mr. Hamid Joda, noted that, “Currently statistics on financial inclusion are daunting. In a population of almost 200 million people, financial inclusion rate is around 63.5 per cent; which means that tens of millions of Nigerians are not in the financial system. This is an urgent mandate for us as an institution. Because for us, this is a clear indicator that in order to achieve an optimal level of financial inclusion in Nigeria, it is imperative that the unbanked and underserved are consistently empowered to further inspire growth and development of our economy. As such, we have created TAJXpress, a financial inclusion suite, leveraging on our innovative technological infrastructure to ensure deployment of our financial inclusion services across all states within our catchment area.
