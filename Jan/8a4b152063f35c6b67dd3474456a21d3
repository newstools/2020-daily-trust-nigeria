A former Minister of Information, Mr. Labaran Maku, has denied meeting with the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and former vice president Atiku Abubakar towards floating a new political party for 2023. An online news platform had reported that Maku met with the two politicians to discuss the modalities for the formation of a new political platform ahead of 2023. But in a telephone interview, Maku described the report as fake, adding that there was no how a meeting between him and the two politicians will be held without it being reported by the media. He urged his supporters and other Nigerians to disregard the report in its entirety, describing it was fake news and the handiwork of disgruntled elements.
