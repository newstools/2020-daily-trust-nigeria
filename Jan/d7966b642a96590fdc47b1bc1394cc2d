The PDP in Katsina State says it is eagerly waiting for the state government to commence the implementation of the Supreme Court judgement on local government administration. The state party chairman, Salisu Majigiri, while speaking at the end of close-door meeting with suspended council chairmen, vice chairmen and councillors over the Supreme Court judgement, said the PDP was set to take over the 34 councils in the state. Majgiri said the APC administration has no other option but to implement the ruling giving the fact that it was delivered in good faith by the Apex court. According to him, it is the same court that upheld the governor’s election which the PDP accepted in good faith. This ruling should be accepted and obeyed. He said the APC administration in the state should just direct former chairmen to return to their positions, adding that “we are optimistic being the state of Mr President. The ruling should be accepted to show example that it is a government of rule of law. “We don’t want what happened in other states like Imo when past chairmen stormed secretariat to take over. We want due process to be followed and things to be done accordingly, “he said.
