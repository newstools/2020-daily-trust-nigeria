The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Ondo State chapter, has chased about 250 cows out of Ijare, Ondo State. The people of Ijare, in Ifedore Local Government, had since three weeks ago been protesting what they called the invasion of their land from Kwara State by herdsmen, who they alleged had been destroying their farm crops. Daily Trust gathered that when Ijare residents, at the weekend, sighted five herdsmen who had led their cows to the town to graze, they quickly informed the leadership of the Miyetti Allah. The association was understood to have then ordered the herdsmen out of the town back to Kwara State, where they reportedly came from. The Ondo State Chairman of Miyetti Allah, Alhaji Bello Garba, told our correspondent on Sunday that when he was alerted of the presence of the herdsmen, he conferred with the townâ€™s traditional ruler, Olujare of Ijare, and thereafter ordered the five herdsmen back to Kwara State.
