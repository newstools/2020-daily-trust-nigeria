A former employee of the National Institute for Chemical Technology Zaria, Shittu Sabi’u has filed a suit against the institution at the National Industrial Court, Kaduna for what he described as his unlawful dismissal from service. He is also demanding for N10 million be paid as damages. In a writ of summons with suit No NICN/KD/03/2020  Sabi’u stated that he voluntarily resigned from his appointment since 16th May, 2019 before a letter of dismissal from service was issued to him on 21st December, 2019. He urged the court to issue an injunction restraining the defendants from communicating the said dismissal to any institution, federal, state or local government service commission or anywhere within and outside the country. The suit, which names Professor Jefferey Tsware Barninas, Director General of the institute its chairman and the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology as defendants, further prayed the court to declare that a letter asking Sabi’u to appear before a disciplinary committee on 21st August, 2019 by the Institute is a breach of his right to fair hearing. He also demanded for a public apology to be published in two national dailies. The plaintiff also prayed the court to order the institution to present a letter of release to him indicating that he voluntarily resigned from their service since May 16, 2019.
