Online critics posited that MTN should have offered reduced or free data tariffs when the leading mobile network operator announced earlier in March that its over 70 million subscribers will be able to send 300 free SMS messages per month as part of the company’s Y’ello Hope package created to assist its customers as a result of the economic implications of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. Five weeks later, it appears that the free-SMS route may have been the way to go as reports from the company’s Q1 financial results show that over one billion free text messages were sent by MTN customers within the first four weeks of introducing the offer! The free SMS package allows MTN Nigeria subscribers across the country to send 10 free SMS daily for 30 days to all networks. With the cost of an SMS pegged at N4, that means MTN has offset an estimated 4 billion Naira worth of text messages in the first month alone.
