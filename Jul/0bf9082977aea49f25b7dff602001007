Miffed by the development, a mob reportedly stormed the road and set the truck ablaze. The mob comprising the youths of the area also reportedly pounced on the driver and beat him to stupor. The Public Relations Officer of the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), Babatunde Akinbiyi in a statement on Saturday, confirmed the accident.

Akinbiyi in a statement explained that the truck driver was coming from Ago-Iwoye inbound Ijebu-Ode, when the incident happened. He said, “the driver, due to speeding, could not control the vehicle as it approached Ibadan roundabout and rammed over a Bajaj motorcycle rider who was trying to negotiate the roundabout at that time. “The driver of the truck was later apprehended after making attempts to run away and was beaten to stupor by the angry mob which also set the truck on fire. “But for the intervention of TRACE, Police, NSCDC and the FRSC, the driver would have been killed and the truck would have been completely burnt down. “The driver has been arrested and taken to Igbeba Motor Traffic Division, Ijebu-Ode, as well as the motor boy. “The body of the deceased has been deposited at the mortuary of Femtop Hospital, Ijebu-Ode, GRA.”
