The Osun State government has shut a popular orphanage home in Ile-Ife, Oroyemi Elizabeth Covenant Home and Care Centre, alleging it has been serving as a baby factory. The Commissioner for Women Affairs in the state, Bukola Olaboopo, confirmed the shut-down of the Home to Daily Trust on Sunday. Speaking through her media aide, Kehinde Oyedele, Olaboopo said the orphanage was shut for “engaging in unwholesome practices” that contravened the state’s Child Rights Law 2013. She alleged that the orphanage was using unprofessional workers and operating in an untidy environment, and that the children there were malnourished. The shut-down of the orphanage shocked the owner, Mrs Elizabeth Oroyemi, who slumped as the facility was being sealed and had to be resuscitated by the ministry’s officials at the scene.
