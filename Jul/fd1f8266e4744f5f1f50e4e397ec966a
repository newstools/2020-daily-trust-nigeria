Gold West Africa, a conference with the objective to develop a sustainable and empowered gold value chain in sub-Saharan Africa is set to hold its second edition in Kano next month. The event is geared towards being able to harness capital for gold exploration, production and trade and to understand how gold is part of the local culture and tradition. The Event Manager, Nicole Smith, said, “Following last year’s policy conference, it was clear that access to finance was a key factor in developing the value chain. “This year, Gold West Africa presents a project finance and investment deal room, showcasing artisanal, small and medium scale gold projects and linking these projects to an investor audience.’ The initiators are working to strengthen gold trading in West Africa especially in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, among others. On what delegates and stakeholders can expect from this year’s festival, Smith said there would also be an unveiling of a digital platform to buy and sell African gold. The conference will also feature a ‘Gold Art Dex Dem’ initiative, an exhibition and auction activity to create links to the region’s gold wealth.
