The governor who just came out of self-isolation, relaxed the lockdown imposed on the state since March 29. Fayemi, directed that the citizens be allowed to come out to trade between 6am and 2pm on Tuesday and Thursday this week to restock and undertake economic pursuits that would keep their households till the curfew will be lifted. Fayemi, who spoke while flagging off Covid 19 Response/Food bank, stated, “I just get out of self-isolation this morning and this is the  first state function I will perform . “I decided to keep away from you in order not to return to self isolation I had to observe as part of the ways to checkmate the spread of this virus”. Fayemi added that the curfew has to be relaxed to allow the people restock, clarifying that harsh measure was taken to protect the lives of the populace in view of the daunting nature of the spread. “We want to appreciate the tolerance and support of our people since the lockdown began. We know that the spread of Covid-19 was daunting, but with unity of purpose, we will overcome. “As part of the measures to protect our people, we shut down the state on March 29 for the initial 14 days with people restricted to their homes. But on Tuesday April 7 and Thursday, April 9, our people are allowed to move about between the hours of 6am and 2pm to restock and the details of this  will be made available later by the Ministry of Justice. “We are particularly sorry for the hardship this lockdown and restriction has brought to our people , especially the poor ones”.
