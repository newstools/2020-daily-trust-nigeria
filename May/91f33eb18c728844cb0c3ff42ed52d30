According to Nghifindaka, Namibia’s economic aspirations to become a logistics hub can be complemented by a strong and modern aviation industry driven by digital transformation and the country should be ready for the 4th industrial revolution. Currently, the DTAC is comprised of 11 members, who were nominated from each of the seven IATA Board geographical regions.
