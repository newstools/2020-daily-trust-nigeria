The Acting Chief Judge of Cross River, Justice Maurice Odey Eneji, has raised three election petition tribunals to hear petitions that may arise after the March 28, 2020, local government election in the state. The chief judge, who inaugurated the tribunals yesterday in his office, said it was in line with the exercise of powers conferred on him by Section 99 of the Cross River State Local Government Law, 2007 and all other powers enabling him. Eneji said the tribunals will sit in the three senatorial zones of the state to attend to election grievances from the different districts. He also constituted the Local Government Election Appeal Tribunal, 2020, in line with Section 104 of the Cross River State Local Government Law, 2007.
