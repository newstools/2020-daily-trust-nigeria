The Supreme Court has fixed Wednesday, February 26 for hearing of the application by the All Progressives Congress (APC) seeking a review of its judgment on February 13 sacking the governor-elect of Bayelsa State, David Lyon and his deputy, Degi Eremionye. Sources at the court said the matter may also be determined the same day. The APC returned to the Supreme Court with an application urging it to reverse its decision disqualifying its candidate in the last governorship election in Bayelsa State, Lyon David. The party, in an application filed by its team of lawyers led by Wole Olanipekun (SAN) and Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), also wants the apex court to set aside the “wrong” interpretation given to its judgment of February 13, 2020 and its subsequent execution by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The party is, among others, contending that the Supreme Court, in its judgment, misinterpreted the November 12, 2019 judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja which it (the Supreme Court) affirmed. The APC argued that the Supreme Court acted without jurisdiction and denied the APC fair hearing when it proceeded to disqualify its governorship candidate even though the Federal High Court, in the judgment by Justice Inyang Ekwo, which the apex court affirmed, refused PDP’s prayer to disqualify Lyon. The party also faulted the interpretation given to the apex court’s judgment by the INEC in deciding to issue the certificate of return to the candidate of the PDP. “In this honourable court’s judgment of 13th February, 2020, the court erroneously and inadvertently stated that the trial High Court consequentially disqualified the applicant‘s governorship candidate even though the trial court made no such order and when the trial court indeed refused to grant the express orders sought by the plaintiffs therein for his disqualification,” APC averred.
