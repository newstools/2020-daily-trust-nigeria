Doyin and Susan Foundation in collaboration with Naija Talent Search is set to take talented youths off the street through a comedy empire television reality show. Thirty seven young Nigerians are scheduled to take part in the Naija comedy empire television reality show in Abuja which is meant to identify and nurture young talents into stardom. The Director of Doyin and Susan Foundation, Ziggy Austin Ogbaki, while addressing journalists in Abuja said Nigeria is a nation of abundant talent and youths are talented in various ways. “However, these talents most often than not, die with them as most of them are unable to reach their God given potentials. This is due to the fact that there is no enabling environment, no financial assistance and no support whatsoever to bring out these talents and help these young stars,” Ogbaki said. Ogbaki said the Naija talent search and Doyin and Susan Foundation having seen this vacuum, and the fact that these youths needed to be taken off the street decided to fill in this gap by ensuring that these talents are tapped and allowed to blossom with the much needed support. “We also want to provide mentorship for the next two years and groom these young talents so they can reach their potentials,” Ogbaki said. Ogbaki said the participants would be drawn from the 36 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as the winner will go home with a cash prize of N10 million,  a new vehicle and several consolation prices. “The Naija comedy empire will start in April this year and will run for a period of six weeks, concluding with an award night for comedy icons.
