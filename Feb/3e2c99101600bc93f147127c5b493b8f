An Ogba, Lagos, chief magistrate court yesterday ordered the remand of a 47-year-old man, Ones Chukwumezie, for allegedly inserting his fingers into the private part of a four-old-girl. Chukwumezie, a resident of 403 Road, C Close, House 43, FESTAC Town, Lagos, allegedly took advantage of the minor when her parents were not around. The defendant, according to the police, lured the little girl into his apartment where he removed her panties, inserted his finger into her private part and was about engaging her sexually when he was caught in the act. The prosecutor, Ezekiel Ayorinde, said, “the parents of the girl reported the matter to the police at the FESTAC Division, upon which Chukwumezie was arrested and later transferred to the Gender Section of the Command. After interrogation, the police decided to charge him to court with the alleged offence.” The court did not take the defendant’s plea after the prosecutor, Ezekiel Ayorinde, asked it to refer the matter to the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. The magistrate, Mrs B. O. Osunsanmi, ordered that Chukwumezie be remanded in prison custody without an option of bail. The court directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send it to the DPP for advice. Osunsanmi adjourned the case till March 16, 2020.
