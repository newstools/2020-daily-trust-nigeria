The girl was received by officers of NAPTIP on Thursday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at about 14:28hrs. She was said to be elated as she stepped on home soil. The Director-General, NAPTIP, Dame Julie Okah-Donli was in Cairo with the Director Research and Programme Development, Mr Godwin Morka, for the regional conference on irregular migration from the Sahel region through the Central Mediterranean, when her attention was called to a victim of trafficking who had fled from her captives and needed help. Okah-Donli, with support of the Nigerian Ambassador to Egypt, Prof Dandatti Abdulkadir, rescued the girl and she had been in the Nigerian Embassy in Cairo until her return.
