Operatives of the Nigerian Navy attached to the Forward Operating Base, Badagry, Lagos State, yesterday handed goods worth over N15 million, which they allegedly seized from  suspected criminals using the Lagos waterways for their activities, to the Operation Swift Response (OSR). The OSR is a joint security task force comprising all security agencies, including the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), set up to combat crimes, especially at the borders and on the nation’s waterways. The Commanding Officer, Naval Forward Operating Base (FOB), Captain Chris Akokota, handing over the goods to OSR officers, said that the criminals abandoned the items and jumped into the waters. “The FOB, in fulfilment of Navy’s policing role, has increased patrols along the waterways extending from Lagos to the Republic of Benin border.  This has led to the arrest of many suspects, which were handed over to OSR men. The arrest of more suspects in the last two months would soon be handed over to the OSR. “I want to warn criminals to desist from illegalities as the Navy would continue to deal decisively with them,” Akokota said. Items the Navy FOB handed over yesterday included five fibre speed boats fitted with outboard engines, one Toyota sport utility vehicle, electronics and electrical fittings, bags of foreign parboiled rice, cosmetics products, bales of used clothes and cartons of frozen turkey. The NCS Deputy Comptroller in charge of enforcement, Rasheed Adahuse, who received the seized goods, said the Customs Service would continue to synergize with the Navy to ensure Nigerian waters were safe.
