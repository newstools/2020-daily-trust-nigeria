The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has urged the six area council chairmen of the FCT to focus on improving education, health and environmental sanitation in their domains. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, Malam Bello gave the admonition when the chairmen paid him a working visit in his office recently. While commending the chairmen for doing well, he charged them to do more on human capital development through three main components of primary education, environmental sanitation and public health. Malam Bello said, “A clean environment and a functional primary healthcare system will mean less people in the communities will become ill with common ailments and will thus become more productive in the farms and other social and entrepreneurial endeavours. “All of us will finish our tenures and we will still live within the communities. This is the time to upgrade your communities and focus on human capital development.” To achieve this, the minister urged them to deploy the same amount of energy and methods utilised during political campaigns to mobilise the people into the development of their communities. He further advised that, “Nothing prevents you from supervising the cleaning of the streets yourselves. “You all have markets and market unions, yet there is refuse everywhere. These are areas where you can show leadership by ensuring they are clean.” Meanwhile, the minister assured that the administration was beefing up security across the FCT by creating additional police formations, and therefore, urged the chairmen to eschew sentiments in the appointment of the community constabularies.
