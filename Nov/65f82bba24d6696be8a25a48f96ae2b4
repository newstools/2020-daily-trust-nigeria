A total of N51bn only representing 45.21 per cent of the budget is earmarked for non-debt recurrent expenditure which consists of both personnel and overhead costs. “The sum of N54.85bn only representing 48.58% of the total budget is earmarked as capital expenditure for the year 2021. “Similarly, the sum of N7bn has been allocated to consolidated revenue fund charges for debt servicing, pension and gratuity. This represents 6.21% of the total budget. The budget framework shows an increase of N4.478bn over and above the fiscal year 2020 original budget estimate; translating to 4.13% increase.
