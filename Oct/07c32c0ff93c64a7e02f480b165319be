A Grade I Area Court in Kubwa, Abuja, on Wednesday, dissolved a seven-year-old marriage between Salamat Dauda and Isiyaka over the man’s refusal to pay school fees for his three children. Salamat, in her petition, prayed the court to dissolve the marriage on the grounds that Isiyaka had failed in his duties as a husband and a father. Delivering judgment, the judge, Muhammad Adamu, ordered the petitioner to observe “Iddah” – a waiting period – for three months before contracting another marriage. Earlier, Salamat told the court that, “Isiyaka abandoned his responsibility as a husband and a father. I pay the school fees of our children and cater to other necessities in our home. I do everything and I am tired of his behaviour.” She, therefore, begged the court to dissolve the marriage contracted under Islamic Law on April 28, 2013. Isiyaka, who works with a construction company in Abuja, consented to his wife’s petition for divorce, saying he had tried his best.
