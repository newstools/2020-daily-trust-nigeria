Federal Government and the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) have announced some strategies to scale up the production of consumables, pharmaceuticals, sanitary and hygiene products. The strategies were part of the outcome of a meeting held in Abuja, which was convened by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment for manufacturers and other stakeholders, to discuss potential threats and impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Nigerian economy. The Industry Minister, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, told journalists that the strategies agreed on by the stakeholders were to keep steady supply of essential commodities needed to curtail further spread of COVID-19. Adebayo said stakeholders agreed that all industries are to do their utmost best to sustain on-going operations in order to avoid reduction of shut-down of production activities. “Government will continue to do everything possible to support industries to sustain their operations and where necessary, even stimulate a surge in production of essential commodities especially medicines and sanitary products,” he said. The Minister said the management of industries would sanitise their production sites and sensitise their workers on compliance with COVID-19 guidelines of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). “All Nigerians are therefore advised not to indulge in any panic behaviour such as panic buying, adulteration, hoarding or price hiking as government, manufacturers and other stakeholders are working closely to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on the populace,” he said.
