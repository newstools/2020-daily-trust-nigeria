 Fire broke out yesterday at the headquarters of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in Maitama, Abuja. Daily Trust observed that the fire gutted some parts of the 4th, 5th and 6th  floors of the seven-storey building. Commenting on the incident, the Registrar-General of the CAC, Alhaji Garba Abubakar, said the fire incident did not affect vital information and documents. He revealed that the fire started at about 10.20 am when one of the outer units of the split air conditioners on the 6th floor in the main building exploded due to power surge. He stated: “The sound attracted the attention of the few personnel within the premises and they immediately mobilized to quench the fire using fire extinguishers and fire hose reels within the building. The fire had descended through the outer AC ducts to the 5th and 4th floors which necessitated a call to FCT Fire Service and they promptly responded.”  The CAC’s boss said only one unit of two horse power split air conditioner and the electric cable leading to it were affected. “The fire has since been contained. There was no casualty arising from the incident.  Furthermore, the Commission’s main building and all records and other vital information have not been affected by the incident”, Abubakar confirmed.
