Over a hundred residents of Lugbe, at the weekend, received food items and cash as palliatives from a church in the area. The church, Holy Ghost Christian Centre (Home of Grace), according to its pastor, Ezekiel Fenwa, decided to help to cushion the effect of the lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and to fulfil the scripture. “We, therefore, decided to give out palliatives in the form of food items like rice, garri, noodles and water to as many that were available,” he said. He said the church authority felt that beyond prayers and intercession, it needed to support the efforts of the government and other well-meaning members of the society “add value to the lives of people that come our way.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
