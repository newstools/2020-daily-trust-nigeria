FCT Minister of State Dr, Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, says the administration has  budgeted N800 million for primary health care leadership, governance and infrastructure upgrade as part of measures to strengthen immunisation and primary health care in the territory. Aliyu said this during the flag off of the National Integrated Mobile Outreach Programme (I-MOP) by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, in Bwari Area Council. This is coming on the heels of a report by Daily Trust which uncovered poor state of primary health centres in the territory. The minister said the sources of funding included the FCT Appropriation Act, 2020, the Saving One Million Lives Programme for Results and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework  (UNDAF). Aliyu said, “Recently, a total of N37,293,000 was disbursed to 62 PHC facilities with each PHC facility per ward in the FCT receiving a total N601,500 in the Direct Facility Funding under the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF).” She affirmed that despite challenges facing the primary healthcare sector, specific findings in the report of the 2018 National Demographic and Health Survey (2018 NDHS), showed that FCT performed well and better than most states in the North Central zone with some figures better than the zonal and national averages.
