A 19-year-old boy, the police in Ondo State described as “an imbecile” has been dragged before an Akure High Court for allegedly defiling the three-year-old grand-daughter of his neighbour. The teenage defendant, Bidemi Ijarade, was said to have committed the offence on October 6, 2019 at Iro Street, Akure, the Ondo State capital. Ijarade was brought before the court on a two-count charge of defilement and indecent assault. He was alleged to have defiled the girl, who was living with her grandmother, when the old woman was not at home. The prosecution told the court that Mrs Victoria Aderemi, the grandmother, said some concerned neighbours had called her on phone when they discovered that the defendant had allegedly raped her little girl. The prosecution added, “She also said she saw blood stains on the girl’s vagina when she came back home and examined her. Some youths in the neighbourhood held the accused person down and prevented him from running away after the act. He was then handed over to the police.” Counsel to Ijarade, P. O. Attah, raised an objection in court that his client was an imbecile and would not understand the charge that would be read to him. The judge, Justice Samuel Bola, responded that Attah could raise the issue of his client’s condition during the presentation of the defence case and assured the lawyer that the defendant’s plea must be taken before the court could proceed with hearing. Ijarade pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecution told the court that it had three witnesses to call in the case and sought for an adjournment to enable it bring them to court. Justice Bola then adjourned the case till April 7, 2020 for hearing.
