Candidates would now resort to the previous system. JAMB disclosed this on its twitter handle on Saturday morning. The message read: “NIN is suspended for 2020 registration. Candidates are to only send names to 55019 to create profile. No need for NI for 2020 registration.” NIN IS SUSPENDED FOR 2020 REGISTRATION.
