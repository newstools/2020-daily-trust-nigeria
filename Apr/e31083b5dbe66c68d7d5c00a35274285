The Lagos State Police Command says it has rescued a 10-year-old girl, identified as Ajara, from the hand of a 45-year-old lady, who the police described as “a fake caregiver.” The video of the woman abusing the child had gone viral on social media. The video, which was first published by a social media reporter through instalblog9ja, prompted the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, to order a discreet investigation into the matter. It was learnt that detectives from the Gender Unit, Command Headquarters, Ikeja, in collaboration with the Lagos State Office of the Public Defender and social workers from the Ministry of Youth and Social Development, rescued Ajara at No. 10, Omotoso Street, Igando. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, disclosed that the caregiver, identified simply as Mrs Omotayo, 45, was later arrested. Elkana said that Omotayo, whom he said claimed she was a caregiver to Ajara, pushed the girl, who sustained injuries all over her face. “The suspect is seen in the viral video hitting the survivor on the floor. The suspect will be charged to court at the end of investigation,” he said.
