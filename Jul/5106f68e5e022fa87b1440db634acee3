The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the mass defection of members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to its fold ahead of the Edo governorship election is an end-of-the-road signpost for the APC and its candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. PDP has fielded the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, while the APC has fielded Osagie Ize-Iyamu as their candidates for the election. The party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, claimed that it had acknowledged the solidarity of thousands of members of other political parties, that have adopted and expressed support for Obaseki as their choice for the election. “Our party has been receiving daily reports of massive surge for PDP membership cards in our state, local government and ward offices, following the soaring popularity of Governor Obaseki and the PDP across the state. “This is in addition to the expressed support of various volunteer groups, as well as professional bodies, community associations, trade unions, youth groups and other critical players across the voting population of the state,” the party said. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed September 19 for the governorship election. Reacting, the state chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Aslem Ojezua, faulted the claim, saying there was no mass defection from APC to PDP in Edo State. “I am not aware of any mass defection of members of the APC to the PDP. “A lot has happened and there is no mass defection in Edo State,” he told our correspondent.
