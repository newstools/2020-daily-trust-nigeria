A gang of armed robbers, Monday evening, stormed the popular IBB market in Suleja town of Niger State, shooting one person in the process. Sources who spoke to City News said the robbers who arrived the area some minutes before 7 pm parked their vehicle outside the market and went straight into a mobile phones shop. “No one was aware of what was taking place inside the shop as they carried out everything quietly,” the source said. It was gathered that in the process of fleeing the area, the robbers missed their exit and they shot into the air which caused commotion where one person among the passersby was hit. A member of the Suleja vigilante group who said they were yet to report for night duty there when the incident took place, added that, the robbers later located their vehicle, and fled the area, while the victim was taken to the Suleja general hospital for treatment.
