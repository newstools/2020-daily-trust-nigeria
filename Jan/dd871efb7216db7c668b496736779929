He added that N439 billion incorporate paper has been issued in comparison with N470bn over the same period in 2018. He said: “We expect the total volume issued in 2019 to eclipse 2018 as markets have seen yields fall to levels unseen since 2015 and a number of issuers are gearing up to take advantage to lock in lower funding rates for extended tenors. Despite the undulating nature of the market, there has been increased sophistication, amongst issuers of the different financing options available in the local debt markets with issuers effectively timing capital markets issuance to maximize cost savings relative to bank debt. We have witnessed an increasing number of corporate issuers exploring alternative funding options such as Green Bonds and Infrastructure Bonds, in addition to conventional bonds, commercial paper and Eurobonds.” The Bonds, Loans and Sukuk Nigeria Conference, organized by GFC Media, is regarded as Nigeria’s only annual debt finance event, covering developments of both on-shore and off-shore markets. page 24 extra ‘Stanbic IBTC facilitated $589 million capital inflow in Q2’ Stanbic IBTC makes key appointments
