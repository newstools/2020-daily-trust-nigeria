The Federal Government has declared Friday, May 1, 2020 as public holiday to mark this year’s International Workers’ Day. The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government, in a statement signed by Georgina E. Ehuriah, the Permanent Secretary in the ministry. This is coming despite lockdown in the Federal Capital Territory, Lagos, Ogun and Kano states. Many states of the federation are also in either total or partial lockdown with ban on large gatherings as part of efforts to halt the spread of the COVID-19 disease. Though, President Muhamadu Buhari has announced a gradual easing of lockdown in the FCT, Lagos and Ogun states, it will only come into effect on May 4. In the statement, the Minister commended Nigerian workers for their resilience, patience and understanding, particularly in their support of President Buhari’s efforts at stemming the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Aregbesola, who further thanked Nigerians and the labour force for their sacrifices in the present period of trial, assured that their commitment and patience will complement the efforts being made by the government and other stakeholders to ensure the speedy control of the virus. He said that with the cooperation of every citizen as well as strict adherence to the measures being put in place by relevant authorities, the challenges being faced by Nigerians as a result of the disease would soon be put behind. The Minister expressed optimism that the economy of the country will come back stronger after the COVID-19 experience, taking cognizance of the various economic stabilisation efforts by the Federal Government. He, therefore, called on Nigerians to remain calm and be hopeful.
