The Chairman of Jigawa State chapter of Sardaunan Kano Vanguard, Comrade Nurah Muhammed, has advised Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to learn from the leadership style of his predecessor, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau. Muhammed, in an interview with Daily Trust in Dutse, said Shekarau ran a successful government that had a harmonious relationship with the traditional institutions throughout his tenure in office. He said the north would be drifting into another disaster if the feud between Kano state government and the traditional institution was allowed to linger, stating that the existing political impasse amongst political class is already taking its toll in the state. Muhammed said the political feud between Ganduje and his immediate predecessor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso would not only affect governance but also the economy of the state. He said the collapse of the trading activities in Kano meant that the entire economy of the north would be in crisis as the State remains the commercial nerve center of the region.
