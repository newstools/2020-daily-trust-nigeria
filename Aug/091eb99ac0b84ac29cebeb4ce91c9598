An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, has sentenced Mohamodu Haruna, 25, to death by hanging. Convicting Haruna yesterday, Justice Adekunle Adeleye said, “There are no surrounding circumstances to destroy the cogency of the circumstantial evidence led against the accused. He was caught in the web of the last seen theory. I find the defendant guilty as charged. He is sentenced to death by hanging.” The prosecutor, Shirley Atanel, said Haruna committed the offence on or about February 12, 2018 at Odo Uro, Iyin Ekiti, Irepodun/Ifelodun local government area of Ekiti State, when he murdered Mohamadu Usman. A witness, who gave his testimony, said he saw two herdsmen coming with their cows while he was on his motorcycle, but discovered later that one of them was returning a blood-stained machete into its sheathe, while the other was lying face down in a pool of his own blood, with machete cuts on his neck. To prove his case, Atanel called four witnesses and tendered exhibits that included the confessional statement of the defendant, photographs of the deceased butchered in the neck and a blood-stained machete. Haruna spoke in his own defence through his lawyer, Yinka Opaleke, and called no witness in the matter.
