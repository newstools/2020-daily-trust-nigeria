Unity Bank was founded in 2006 from the merger of nine commercial banks; the biggest in Sub-Saharan Africa, following a consolidation exercise mandated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in 2004 The bank’s story, post-capitalisation, has been a tortuous one. It had a large proportion of its loans held by its board members. As at December, 2017, a total of N23bn was held as loans by past and present directors. This same group also had a high proportion of non-performing loans. Non-performing insider loans amounted to N15.3bn as at December, 2016. The bank also had to contend with the obvious challenge of raising fresh capital as the funds required to bring it back to shape were enormous. As at that time, a total of N52bn had been loaned to the bank by CBN. Total indebtedness was N50bn in 2016, and an additional N2bn was lent to the bank in H1 2017. The Managing Director of the bank, Mrs. Oluwatomi Somefun, in an interview with Daily Trust, said: “In 2015, when we took over, we decided to be truthful to ourselves because we could not continue to accumulate interest on loans that were not performing. If you look at 2014 and 2015, there was a huge decline in the bank’s revenue. That was because we decided not to earn interest on loans that were not performing. So, we stopped that.

A lot of the profit of that period came from this same loans that were not performing. So the sensible thing to do was to reverse the entire profit that was recognised and reported. We had to write back and revised previous years’ profit. It wasn’t something that we could do at a go. As we were discovering we were writing off.” Three years into that cleansing, Unity Bank has declared a gross earnings of N44.59bn for the 2019 financial year, continuing a path to strong growth started in the 2018 financial year. The audited 2019 full year result showed that the bank recorded a PBT of N3.64bn, while PAT closed at N3.38bn, thereby consolidating on the gains on the reforms instituted by the bank to grow a healthy balance sheet since the past two years. The PBT was coming from a N14bn loss in 2017 to a negative -N7.5bn in 2018 to now N3.6bn, which indicates a 148 per cent improvement year-on-year. This is despite the regulatory head winds and reduction in fee charges across the banking sector. A review of the bank’s performance shows a relatively strong growth across key financial metrics such as the Net Operating Income for the year ended December, 2019, which rose by 76.39 per cent to N23.211bn from N13.159bn in the corresponding period of 2018. Net Interest Income also posted strong growth as it grew by 18.06 per cent to N16.493bn from N13.970bn the previous year. To tell the story of the net income more, fees and commission grew by 116 per cent in 2019 in what analysts refer to as a test of value delivery. The retail lender also recorded a total comprehensive income of N5.52bn while Earnings Per Share stood at 28.94 kobo. The bank grew its loan books by 135.87 per cent to N104.02bn in 2019 as against the N44.10bn it closed in 2018. Looking at the 2019 result alone does not tell the whole story, a cursory look at the last three years shows that the bank’s asset base has grown by 95 per cent, from N134bn in 2017 to N210bn in 2018 (55 per cent) and to N293bn in 2019 (71 per cent). Commenting on the results, Somefun said, “The potential in many aspects of the business as reflected in growing balance sheet of the bank is indicative of market confidence in our repositioning effort. One area of interest to stakeholders is the issue of recapitalisation. The process suffered a slow down due to the 2019 elections and the resultant “let’s wait and see” approach by foreign investors. COVID-19 has also posed another challenge as the restriction on travels has ensured that some due diligence has to be put on hold. Speaking in this regards, the Executive Director, Finance and Operations of the Unity Bank, Ebenezer Kolawole, said the bank’s journey towards capital injection was on course because, “We are working with both local and foreign investors. The journey is on course and will conclude very soon.” He added that the bank had attracted N40bn deposit in the last six months and had a loan to deposit ratio of 0.9 per cent; the least in the industry.
