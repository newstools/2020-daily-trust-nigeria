The newly appointed chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum and governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, says the forum will work with the National Working Committee (NWC) to strengthen the party and deepen democracy in the country. Tambuwal is to take over from Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State whose tenure as chairman of the forum would elapse in two weeks’ time. Speaking during the opening session of the 88th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting yesterday in Abuja, Tambuwal said the forum would have a common agenda towards ensuring the growth of the party. He pledged that the governors would also ensure that the party’s programmes and manifesto are implemented in their respective states, adding that they would support the party in its drive for membership and development. “Let me start by thanking God Almighty for not only sparing our lives to witness today’s 88th NEC meeting in good health but also for his favour and mercy on all of us and particularly the responsibility vested on me by my colleagues, members of the PDP Governors’ Forum to step into the shoes of my brother, Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State soon after his term of office. “We will soon begin to institutionalise peer review mechanism where we shall be comparing notes as governors of the PDP with a common agenda, a common programme in ensuring that we have all of that implemented across our states. “I assure you, my brothers and indeed the party, that by the grace of God, we shall work together to continue to strengthen our party and deepen democracy in Nigeria. “We assure you as your governors that we shall continue to work together in unity and with the NWC in ensuring that the programmes of the party, especially in our respective states in line with our manifestoes, are implemented,” he said. Earlier, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State who presented Tambuwal as the new chairman of the forum said his emergence was a unanimous decision by the governors.
