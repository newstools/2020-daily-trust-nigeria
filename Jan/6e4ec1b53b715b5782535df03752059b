A fire outbreak has razed down 39 shops, ravaging furniture worth over N21 million at Kugbo furniture market in Abuja. City News gathered that the fire, which broke out at about 12:00 am, destroyed the City Furniture area of the market located by the roadside between Mogadishu Barracks and Nyanya. Victims of the inferno told our reporter that they were alerted about the incident by security guards on night duty at about 12:00am yesterday. Chairman of the city furniture area, Austin Onuh, who is also a victim, said the incident occurred in the early hours of Monday when all the shop owners had closed. He regretted that most of the furniture burnt were given to them on contract by their customers. “We are yet to determine the cause of the inferno but pieces of furniture worth over N21 million naira have been burnt by the fire. “Some of us just returned from Christmas and New Year celebrations and started work but this morning we only came to see ashes” he said. Onuh appealed to FCT Administration, spirited individuals and corporate organisations to support them. He also called on the government to provide firefighting facilities to the market so as to prevent a reoccurrence. Timothy Eze, one of the affected furniture makers, said he has lost not less than N 8 million worth of furniture in his shop. “Apart from the furniture, industrial machine, generators with several working equipment worth millions were also burnt” Another victim, Vincent Ngutsen said over N 7 million finished and unfinished furniture were burnt in his shop located at the same area. According to him, despite efforts by the people around the area and the fire fighters, they were not able to put out the furniture. 15 blocks of shops razed in Kano night fire Tales of woe from Plateau’s many market infernos Fire razes houses, shops in Madalla
