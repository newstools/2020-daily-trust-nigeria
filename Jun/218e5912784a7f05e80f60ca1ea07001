The corpses of two children were yesterday brought out from under the rubble of a collapsed house located at No. 46, Gafari Balogun Street, Ogudu, Lagos State. Two other lucky ones were rescued by officials of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA). The bodies of the two children had been deposited at the mortuary of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, while the injured ones were treated by the medical team of the Lagos State Ambulance Service. “We were hopeful the children would be rescued alive. But, unfortunately, two of them died, while two others sustained injuries,” a neighbour, Tolupe Ayorinde, said.

Another neighbour, Matthew Arinze, said that the children were sleeping when the house collapsed. “If schools had been in session, it is most likely the children wouldn’t be in the house at that time of the morning,” Arinze said. The LASMA Director-General, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, who confirmed the incident, said that the agency received a call at 12.40pm about a collapsed building at the aforementioned location. Oke-Osanyintolu said that agency responders observed, on arrival at the scene, that the building collapsed as a result of a mudslide at its rear caused by yesterday’s heavy rainfall. “The agents were informed that two children, one male and one female, were trapped and immediately commenced a search-and-rescue operation. Unfortunately, they were found dead and their remains are being transported to the mortuary. “Integrity testing will be carried out on the remainder of the building, which has now been cordoned off,” he said How school children died in Lagos building collapse Lagos residents count floods of losses 3 years after abduction, DSS rescues 2 children in Kebbi
