Daily Trust reports that there was panic at the airport on Wednesday evening when the two aircraft got involved in a wingtip collision.

Its spokesman, Tunji Oketunbi said: “The Turkish cargo aircraft was parked at the international apron when the Middle East airbus was taxing before it ran into it, cutting through the tail cone and damaged part of the right horizontal stabiliser of the Turkish aircraft.” “All passengers on the Middle East Airline had to disembark with no injury or fatality. The Bureau will appreciate that the general public and press do not pre-empt the cause of the serious incident until a formal report is issued.” Turkish Airlines, MEA planes involved in wing tip collision at Lagos Airport AIB probes Turkish Airlines incident at Port Harcourt airport AIB probes Turkish Airlines’ serious incident at Port Harcourt Airport
