The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, disclosed this in Abuja yesterday at a briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. “This company applied severally as to operate humanitarian flights and we did approve. It is very clear at the beginning of this exercise that we defined what those flights should be: essential flights basically – cargo, medical evacuation, medical supplies, and so on and so forth. “Unfortunately, this company decided to become commercial in their service, charging money and flying people in and out.

So, we believe this shouldn’t happen,” Sirika said. Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
