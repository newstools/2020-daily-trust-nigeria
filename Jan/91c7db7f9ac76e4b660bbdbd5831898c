About 16,163 Rice Farmers have received farm inputs worth N200,000 each  for the 2020 dry season farming in Taraba state. The loan was provided by Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) to its registered members. The Taraba State Chairman of the association, Mallam Tanko Andami said during the distribution of the farm inputs in Jalingo at the weekend that the association secured the loan through Unity Bank. He said the loan facility was guaranteed by the Central Bank of Nigeria under its anchor borrower scheme. He said apart from the inputs, each beneficiary will receive N60, 000 cash from Unity Bank to take care of cost of labour in the rice farms. The chairman stated that beneficiaries of the loan are expected to repay after harvest. He said this was the second time the loan was extended to rice farmers in the state, adding that the scheme had helped boost rice production.
