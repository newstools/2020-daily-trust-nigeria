Gombe State Governor, Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya has suspended the Chairman and management board of the state Board of Internal Revenue (BOIR). A statement issued by the governor’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Ismaila Uba Misilli, said the suspended Chairman Salisu Adamu Dukku is to hand over the affairs of the board to the chairman of the state Fiscal Responsibility Commission, Abubakar Inuwa Tata, who will take charge as administrator pending further action. According to the statement, the chairman Salisu Dukku and three members; Abubakar Magaji Difa, Ismail Ishaq and Umar Shamaki Tula are to report to the office of the Secretary to the State Government for further instructions. Meanwhile the BOIR Head of Collections, Sadiq Abubakar Mohammed, Head of Internal Control, Sulaiman Adamu and State Motor Registrar, Mohammed Usman Bello were directed to hand over to their immediate subordinates and report to the office of the Head of Service for further Instructions. However, the statement was silent about the reason for suspending the revenue board management, less than seven months after their appointments. But an impeccable source at the BOIR said their suspension was related to poor performance in office and alleged embezzlement of revenue generated by the agency. “Apart from poor performance in terms of revenue generation since their appointment about seven months ago, there were allegations of embezzling the little fund being generated by the board,” the source said.
