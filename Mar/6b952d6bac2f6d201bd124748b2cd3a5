The Amalgamated Commercial Motorcycles Riders Association of Nigeria (ACOMORAN), Ogun State chapter, says it has set up a task force to arrest its members who violate the state government’s directives on coronavirus and hand them over to the police. The chapter’s Chairman, Kayode Showunmi, disclosed this yesterday while distributing free face masks and hand gloves to commercial motorcyclists in Abeokuta, the state capital. The state government had on Monday ordered motorcycle riders not to carry more than one passenger and also ensure they use face masks and hand gloves always. Showunmi explained that the association would continue to educate its members on the dangers associated with the virus, saying it was important they heed the advice. “The state government’s directive not to carry more than one passenger is for our own good and we must abide by it,” he said. He noted that members of the association had been following the state government’s directive on how to avoid contracting and spreading the coronavirus disease. Showunmi warned that any member who violates the warnings and government’s order would face the wrath of the law, adding that all hands must be on deck to fight the virus. “We have told all our members to comply with all the directives and we have set up a task force that will enforce compliance. All those who do not comply will be arrested and handed over to the police for necessary actions to be taken on them. “We have sent signals to all our branches and units in the state to comply with the directives. Money without health is nothing,” he said.
