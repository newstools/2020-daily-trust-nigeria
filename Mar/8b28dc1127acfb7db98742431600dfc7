A former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr Obadiah Mailafia, has expressed optimism that Nigeria can become a world power in the next half of the century if things are done correctly. He made the remarks in Abuja yesterday at a colloquium with the theme “unity and faith, peace and progress” to celebrate the 50th birthday of Kudla Satumari-Haske, Founder of Haske Satumari Foundation. Mailafia who was the presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in the 2019 election, explained Nigeria must do all it takes to achieve greatness. He noted that the mode of politics and leadership structure must be reexamined for positive change. According to him, even though many look at the 1914 amalgamation of the defunct Southern and Northern Protectorates as a coming together of unwilling partners, the former CBN deputy governor said the country can still progress despite all odds. Mailafia, however, expressed worry that Nigerians no longer interact the way they should because of religious and ethnic divides. The Chairman, Haske Satumari Foundation, Dr Alfred Gadzama said the organization was established to change narratives for grassroots communities, youth, the vulnerable and look at positive change. Among lead discussants at the colloquium were Femi Fani-Kayode, former Minister of Aviation, Professor Emman Shehu, Director, International Institute of Journalism, (IIJ), Abuja and Folorunso Aliu, Group Managing Director, TELNET.  20% of money in circulation fake - Mailafia ADC presidential candidate sets agenda for 9th NASS lawmakers-elect Baba Mailafia Gambo (1914-2014)
