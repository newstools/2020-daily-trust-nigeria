The Federal Ministry of Interior and Nigeria Immigration Service has approached the Court of Appeal in Lagos and filed a stay of execution of the judgment on collection and remittance of the Combined Expatriate and Residence Permit Aliens Card fees. The judgment, delivered by a Federal High Court in Lagos presided over by Justice Rilwanu Aikawa, upheld the argument of human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, that it is unconstitutional for the ministry to engage a private firm, Continental Transfert Technique Ltd, to collect the fees on behalf of the NIS. The ministry said the order for the stay of execution on the judgment came into force pending its determination by the Court of Appeal. In the appeal, the ministry is challenging the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to entertain Falanaâ€™s originating summons. The Director of Legal Services in the Ministry, B.E Jeddy-Agba, said the ministry was dissatisfied and aggrieved by the judgment and inevitably had to appeal the judgment.
