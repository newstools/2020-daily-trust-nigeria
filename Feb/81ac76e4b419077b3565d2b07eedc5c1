President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration’s war against corruption is yielding results and receiving commendations locally and internationally. He said this in Abuja yesterday at the public presentation and launch of a book “One Step Ahead: Life as a Spy, Detective and Anti-Graft Czar” by a former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Farida Waziri. Buhari, represented by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, described corruption as the major challenge of governance and development “which we must all seek to eliminate from our system. “We’ve made significant effort in loot recovered; leakage blocked. If the impact has not been too apparent to some observers, it is because of the deep root corruption has taken and extent of the spread before our advent.” Waziri said she wrote the book to put the story of her life together and fill the gaps in the history of Nigeria.
