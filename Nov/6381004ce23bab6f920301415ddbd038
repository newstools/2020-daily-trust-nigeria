The Commander, Abuja Metro, ACP Nuruddeen Sabo, has been awarded the Symbol of Peace medal by the Arewa Youth Peace Initiative (AYPI) for his role in maintaining peace and order in the metropolitan area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Receiving the award in his office, Sabo said he was elated to be so honoured at a time the entire Nigeria Police Force (NPF) was in the eye of the storm and therefore dedicated the award to his subordinates. He said, “I also want to state that I am happy because the award is coming at a time the entire police force is in the eye of the storm, but in every organisation, you must have bad eggs who spoil the image of others. This award confirms that there are good people in the police.”  The Commander, Abuja Metro, ACP Nuruddeen Sabo, has been awarded the Symbol of Peace medal by the Arewa Youth Peace Initiative (AYPI) for his role in maintaining peace and order in the metropolitan area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
