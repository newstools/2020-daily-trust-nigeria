Imo State Governor Hope Uzodinma says he will forfeit his security vote to enable him to meet the payment of salaries and pension in the state. The governor, who spoke when he met with the Imo Economic Development Initiative, led by Professor Maurice Iwu, at the government house in Owerri, said he took the decision because of the paucity of funds he inherited. He also disclosed that his next plan was to establish power and petrochemical plants to boost electricity supply in the state. A statement signed by his press secretary, Oguwuike Nwachukwu, said, Uzodinma noted that industrialisation cannot thrive when power is epileptic, assuring that a power plant is top on his agenda. “Only the best brains shall be appointed to serve in my cabinet,” he said. “We are reviewing the budget earlier passed by the state House of Assembly with a view to streamlining it with current realities,” he said.
