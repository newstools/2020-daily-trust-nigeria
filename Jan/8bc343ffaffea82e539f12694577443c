An Ado Ekiti High Court on Thursday sentenced four men to seven yearsâ€™ imprisonment each for stealing noddles, cigarettes and also for burglary. Justice Bamidele Omotosho handed down the judgment to Owoeye Ojo, Agbetuyi Taiwo, Adeniyi Busayo and Lasisi Friday for break-in and stealing from a shop. The judge said that he found them guilty of the two counts of burglary and stealing based on their confessional statements and the responses from the witnesses called during the trial. The court did not give them an option of fine. The judge, however, did not find them guilty on the conspiracy allegation, which they were also charged with. The prosecution counsel, Wale Fapohunda from the state Ministry of Justice, had during trial said that the convicts committed the offences on August 26, 2017 at Enu Odi, Odo-Ado in Ado-Ekiti. He said during the trial that the convicts broke into a shop belonging to one Mrs Iyabo Ige between 2a.m. and 5a.m. on August 26, 2017. He said that they carted away several items that include: packs of noodles, cigarettes, tin milk and batteries. He said that the offences contravened Sections 413 and 516 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti, 2012. The prosecution called three witnesses and tendered exhibits that include: pictures, eye witnesses, statements by the convicts and the stolen items. The counsel to the defendants, Yinka Opaleye and Adekunle Ojo, had then called only a witness, but pleaded for leniency for their clients. They also prayed the court to temper justice with mercy on the defendants whom they said were first offenders.
