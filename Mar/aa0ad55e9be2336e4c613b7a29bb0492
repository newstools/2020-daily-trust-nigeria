The Deputy National Chairman (North) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Lawal Shuaibu, has stated that he was never suspended by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. Senator Lawal in a press statement made available to journalists yesterday in Abuja said the impression about him being suspended by the NWC was incorrect. He said there is nowhere under the constitution of the party where either the National Working Committee under article 13.4 or the national chairman under article 14 is empowered to discipline,  suspend any member or officer of the party. He added that the purported suspension only exists in the imagination of the purveyors of the misinformation.
