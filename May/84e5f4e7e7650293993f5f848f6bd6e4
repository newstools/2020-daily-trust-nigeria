According to her, this is an opportunity for mothers to inculcate good moral upbringing and values in their children as this is the best gift for the child. She added that, “Good upbringing, norms, values and proper education will make them stand tall irrespective of the challenges ahead of them. “As parents, we should note that giving a child all the education in the world, with no moral value, means you have trained an incomplete child.” (NAN)  9th Assembly: NCWS solicits appointment of more women into principal position ‘How we intend to celebrate Easter amidst lockdown’ 2019: Council urges women to guide husbands, children against violence
