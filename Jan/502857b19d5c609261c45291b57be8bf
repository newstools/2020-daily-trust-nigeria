Anthony Nwakaeme scored twice while John Obi Mikel put in an impressive shift to help Trabzonspor secure a comfortable 6-0 victory against Kasımpasa in Sunday’s Turkish Super Lig game. After starring in their Cup triumph over Denizlispor, where he found the back of the net, Nwakaeme continued his fine form at Medical Park Arena. The 30-year-old striker notched his sixth league goal in the 29th minute after Jose Sosa and Alexander Sorloth had given the Black Sea Storm a 2-0 lead. In the 47th minute, the Apaches were reduced to 10 men after Jorge Fernandes received his second yellow card and was subsequently sent off. Nwakaeme set up Sorloth for his second goal in the encounter and then grabbed his brace in the 83rd minute before Sorloth completed his hat-trick to seal the rout. The Nigeria international was on parade for the duration of the game along with his compatriot and former Super Eagles captain Mikel, who delivered a solid defensive performance to ensure the Black Sea Storm kept a clean sheet in the encounter.
