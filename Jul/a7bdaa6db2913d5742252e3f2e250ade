A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Rosula Foundation, on Friday, distributed foodstuff to communities across the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as part of palliatives to the needy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The representative and a volunteer of Rosula, Bolanle Adejumo, said the feeding programme was borne out of the hunger that the lockdown brought to the people. She said the founder of Rosula, Princess Rosemary Osula-Atu, discovered that during and after the lockdown, the hunger in the land was overwhelming, and noted that people were hungry and there was no work to do to make ends meet. A beneficiary, Mr. Maxwell Chukwuemeka, commended the group for the donation. The foodstuff was donated to Nyanya, Karu, Jikwoyi, Asokoro village, Mpape, Katampe 1 and 2, Jahi, Kado-Kuchi 1 and 2, Apo village, Kabusa, Galadinmawa, Dape village, Iddo village, Gbese, Lugbe 1, 2 and 3, Kubwa town, Arab road, Phase 3 and 4, and Gishiri village communities.
