As the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) gets set to disburse the N50bn COVID-19 stimulus package for households and small businesses, the President of the United Furniture Dealers Association of Nigeria, Emeka Egwuekwe, has urged the Federal Government to include its members in the package to save the industry. He said that the furniture manufacturing industry had lost over N600 million during the COVID-19 lockdown, noting that if care is not taken, many of companies will shut down after the pandemic. Speaking in Abuja on Sunday where he distributed the COVID-19 palliatives to some communities in the FCT and his home community Enugu-Agidi, Egwuekwe, said the distributed items were part of his corporate social responsibility and giving back to the society. The communities in the FCT that benefitted from the palliatives which include food stuffs, bags of rice and noodles, hand sanitizers, face masks and money are Kugbo 1 and Kugbo 11 communities and the furniture market. Egwuekwe, while commending the Federal Government on its efforts to contain the virus and alleviate the sufferings of Nigerians, charged the government and its agencies to display transparency and accountability in the disbursement of palliatives and conditional cash transfer to millions of poor Nigerians to  alleviate the hardship necessitated by the COVID-19 lockdown. He said: “The government should look into our sector, the furniture industry as if care is not taken a lot of furniture dealers would go out of business after this COVID-19 pandemic. “So, I am pleading with the Federal Government to include us in the bailout funds. We have lost over N600m not only in revenue this market has lost over N600m because of the lockdown”, he pleaded.
