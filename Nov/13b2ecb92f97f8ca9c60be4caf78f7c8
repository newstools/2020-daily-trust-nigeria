The federal government has been charged to deploy local talent and expertise in infrastructural development to stop the current rate of brain drain. Former president of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering, Engr. (Dr.) Edet Amana, said many young people were leaving the country because most infrastructural projects are being given to foreigners who he said import cheap labour. He was delivering a lecture on “The Nigerian Infrastructure Conundrum – The Missing Links” during the investiture of the new president of the Academy, Engr. Alex Ogedegbe, and the induction of new fellows in Lagos. The lecturer lamented that the country’s infrastructure growth is stunted by poor planning and policy inconsistencies. Outgoing president, Prof. Fola Lasisi, said the academy was concerned about the failure of infrastructure in Nigeria and assured that everything possible would be done to support the government.
