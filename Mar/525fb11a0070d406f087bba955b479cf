The committee, in a statement on Monday in Abuja and signed by its Secretary General, Is’haq Y. Zango, said that their stance was based on extensive consultations and due diligence with various stakeholders, including medical doctors, some Abuja based senior Imams and Ulamas; the grand Muftee of Nigeria, Sheikh Sherrif Ibrahim Saleh, and the leadership of the NSCIA. “We hereby support the calls for halting of all congregational prayers in large numbers, in all the mosques or musallas (designated prayer spots), be it for Juma’ah prayers or khamsu salawat (five regular daily prayers), or even closing of the Masajid where necessary, all in the bid to curtail the spread of this dangerous calamity that befalls the humanity in general called Covid-19 otherwise known as Coronavirus. This closure should please include all Islamiyyah schools till further notice. “We can pray and congregate with our families or small groups in our households or offices. While we intensify prayers and repentance to Allah to protect us and lift these calamities off the Ummah and humanity,” Zango said.
