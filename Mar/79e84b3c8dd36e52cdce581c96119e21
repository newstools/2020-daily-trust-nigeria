British actor, Idris Elba, and Game of Thrones star, Norwegian Kristofer Hivju, have announced that they tested positive for coronavirus, as their posts stirred up conversations among social media users. “And it sucks,” Elba announced in a Twitter video on Monday, noting. “I’m doing okay”, just as Hivju’s test results for coronavirus came back positive as announced on his Instagram page. Both were the latest actors who have tested positive for Covid-19 after Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita.  Hijvu had “mild symptoms” of cold, but Elba had no symptoms. Both went ahead with a test though. “There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading,” Hivju posted on Instagram. “Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country’s Center for Disease Control’s website.”   Greetings from Norway! Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My familiy and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health – I only have mild symptoms of a cold. There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country’s Center for Disease Control’s website, and follow the regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. @grymolvaerhivju #fightcorona #solidarity #takecare #folkehelseinstituttet Thanks to @panoramaagency A post shared by  Kristofer Hivju (@khivju) on Mar 16, 2020 at 1:48pm PDT Elba tweeted, “I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus.

Thanks for being a leader and sharing this, Idris. More people need to be taking COVID19 seriously. Any of us can be impacted.

Best wishes! — Monica Sanchez (@moniconga) March 16, 2020  The point that Elba got tested while not showing symptoms has also opened up a different vista on coronavirus testing requirements and restrictions in the UK and US.
