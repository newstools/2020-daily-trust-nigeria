The Court of Appeal in Abuja will today commence hearing in the appeal by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, challenging his suspension by an FCT High Court. The appellate court, presided by Justice Abubakar Datti Yahaya, had earlier ordered a stay of execution on the order of the high court after it found merit in the ex parte application moved on Tuesday by Oshiomhole’s counsel, Wole Olanipekun (SAN). “We are of the view that an emergency picture has been painted, so that an intervention by this court at this time, and in this process, is warranted,” Justice Yahaya said. In a Notice of Appeal No. FCT/HC/CV/837/2020, Oshiomhole asked the appellate court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of the high court delivered on March 4. The application, which has four grounds of appeal, joins the following ward members of APC in Edo as respondents: Comrade Mustapha Salihu, Anselm Ojezua, Alhaji Sani Gomina, Hon. Fani Wabulari, Evangelist Princewilll Ejogharado, the Inspector General of Police, and the State Security Services.
