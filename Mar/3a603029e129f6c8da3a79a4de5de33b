The Chief Press Secretary to the minister, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, in a statement, thanked the retiring President of the Court of Appeal for her passion for the welfare of judges, especially, in their efforts to own their own homes. “I want to acknowledge the passion that you have exhibited in terms of trying to ensure that judges in Nigeria get well accommodated because this is something you have always mentioned to me and you have pursued it vigorously in your office. I assure you that all your advice on this matter, especially the need for judges to retire to their own personal houses, I will also be among those who will champion that by virtue of my office,” Bello said.
