The Chairman of Kwali Area Council of the FCT, Danladi Chiya, has said the killing of his people by bandits is getting out of hand. Chiya, while speaking with newsmen after a security meeting which had representatives of security agencies and traditional rulers in attendance at the conference hall of the council, said the upsurge in attacks by the gunmen was giving residents sleepless nights. He said it was on that premise that the council decided to summon an emergency security meeting to deliberate on how to tackle and checkmate kidnappings and killings by bandits in the area. He stressed the need for all security agencies to synergise to ensure that insecurity in the area was tackled.
