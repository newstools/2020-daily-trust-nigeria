The National Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research (NITR) says it is still using laboratories built during the colonial era. Its Director-General, Dr Augustine Igwe, said this in Kaduna at the weekend when the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, paid a facility visit to the institute. Igwe said the institute intended to build new laboratory structures. The minister said the Federal Government would redouble its effort towards eradicating tsetse flies in order to ensure food security for the country. According to him, “For Nigeria to provide livestock to meet the protein needs of the people, tsetse fly eradication is quite important”.  ‘Institute can make Nigeria tsetse free’ ‘N776bn fertiliser subsidy lost to fraud in 30 years’ Science &Tech Bank still coming - FG
