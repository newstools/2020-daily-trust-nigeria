The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Ekiti State Command, has stated its intention to approach the court to seek an order of forfeiture and sale of 43 cows to compensate farmers whose farms and products were destroyed in Orin-Ekiti. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Tolu Afolabi, said the cows were arrested in Orin Ekiti, where they were found destroying farms and the storage bans of some farmers. Afolabi added that the farmers in the town were ready to kill the cows in retaliation, necessitating the intervention of the NSCDC and the intention to keep the cows in its custody. The NSCDC described the cost of the upkeep of the cows, in feeding and veterinary services, as “enormous”. Afolabi told our correspondent yesterday that since the arrest of the cows, all efforts to identify their owners had proved abortive. He said the Command was appealing to the Cattle Breeders Association in the state to inform its members that 43 cows had been in the custody of the Command for over one month.
