The Young Progressives Party (YPP), yesterday, ratified the nominations of eight new officers to fill vacant positions in its National Executive Committee (NEC). Speaking to newsmen at the 19th NEC meeting of the party, the National Chairman, Comrade Bishop Amakiri, commended the commitment of the federal government to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic but raised concern on the rising cases of rape and the virus in the country. He said if the trend continued, it portended grave danger; beyond what corruption, insecurity and mis-governance may have caused the nation in the last two decades. Some of the newly appointed NEC members are; Dr. (Mrs.) Appolonia Obiageri Ezeadili, Deputy Woman Leader; Mrs Anita Zugwei-Chukwu, Deputy National Government Liaison Adviser; Hajiya Faiza Tafida, North-West Zonal Woman Leader; Mr Williams Moses, Deputy Organising Secretary; and Chief Chris Ifesi, South-East Zonal Chairman.
