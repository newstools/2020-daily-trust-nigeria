A former Special Assistant to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State on Urban Beautification, Hashim Sulaiman Dungurawa, has said he has no regret dumping his former boss and the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and the People Democratic Party (PDP). Dungurawa resigned as Ganduje’s aide in March last year before the rerun governorship election in the state, saying that his former boss was defeated at the poll. In an interview with our correspondent in Abuja, Dungurawa said he resigned his position and dumped the APC to protect his dignity. “I cannot work for corrupt government that doesn’t protect the interest of the state and its people. Looking at the situation so far, it has failed us and I don’t regret decamping to Kwankwasiyya and PDP. “We lost the election as incumbent government with over 20,000 vote’s margin but Ganduje could not accept the will of Allah. It is better for me to be here because I know in 2023 elections, we will vote them out again and we will see if they will accept it or not,” he said. On Kwankwasiyya movement, Dungurawa said it has gone beyond Nigeria. “We are getting invitations from neighbouring countries to go and support them with our ideologies and campaign strategies,” he said. ‘Jonathan handlers have accepted defeat in Kano’ Are Kwankwaso and Ganduje now political foes? ‘Why Kwankwaso cannot be ousted like Nyako’
