In his remark during the ceremony, the Chairman of Governing Council of FCE Zaria, Dr. Bello Yusuf Lafiaji, said in line with the promise made during his interaction with the college community, the staff of FCE Zaria were receiving all their privileges and allowances as at when due. Dr. Lafiaji said when the council came on board, it met huge deficit in terms of staffing, motivation and backlog of unpaid staff claims and allowances. He, however, said the council under his leadership was handling all issues that were hindering the smooth operation of the college. He added that, “We reached out to organisations and individuals with the aim of achieving a cutting edge status for the college in terms of human, institutional and infrastructural development. The council has fulfilled its promise to accord high premium to staff welfare, well-being and motivation. In this wise, we ensure that all allowances and privileges due to staff are paid as at when due. The agitations arising from the payment of Peculiar Academic Allowances (PAA) were squarely addressed through dialogue and sincere commitment to resolutions reached between the management and staff unions. “The council examined the need for a review of the staff development policy and guide. Accordingly, council approved certain key amendments to the policy to not only align it with international best practices, but to ensure its conformity with the yearnings and aspirations of staff. Today, and following this amendment, we can state with no fear of contradiction that staff in their hundreds have benefitted from the staff development policy.” Accolades as FCE Zaria gets accreditation for all NCE courses Gov Bello wants FCE Okene changed into university Dr. Ademola named FCE (Tech) Akoka new Provost
