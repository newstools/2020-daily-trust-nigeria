The Bauchi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has distributed protective materials against the coronavirus pandemic to people of the state. State Chairman of the party Alhaji Uba Nana, who flagged off the distribution at the state party secretariat yesterday, said the items included face masks, hand sanitisers, tissue paper and hand gloves towards curbing the spread of the virus in the state. According to him, the gesture was meant to assist people to protect themselves against contracting the virus. Nana said the protective materials have now become very scarce and expensive in the state making it difficult for some citizens, especially the less privileged, to buy them. He appealed to charity organisations and wealthy individuals to also assist the people with similar items and advised the general public in the state to strictly comply with the guidelines on how to protect themselves from contracting the disease.
