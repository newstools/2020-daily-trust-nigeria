Daily Trust has reliably gathered that Nasarawa State government has decided to relocate the deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, to Awe Local Government Area (LGA) from Loko village in Nasarawa LGA. Daily Trust gathered that the deposed emir was relocated because Loko is a very remote area in the state. The Emir is currently at the Nasarawa State Government House in preparation for movement to Awe LGA. The deposed Emir was initially banished to Opanda town in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. A source, who preferred anonymity, had told Daily Trust exclusively that: “Actually, the deposed emir was scheduled to be exiled from Kano to Opanda town in Toto Local Government but there was a change of decision at the last minute. “Notable Nigerians like the Emir of Lafia, Justice Sidi Bage (rtd) personally met Governor Abdullahi Sule and requested for a change of location. “Others who called the governor were Alhaji Aliko Dangote and General Aliyu Gusau amongst others,” the source said. Sanusi’s removal Emir Sanusi was dethroned over disrespect to the office of the governor and other government agencies. The Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Usman Alhaji, said the emir’s action violated the part 3 section A-E of Kano state law, hence the removal. He said the removal was in line with consultation with relevant stakeholders. Emir Sanusi was taken to Nasarawa state from his palace around 4:30pm yesterday. “It took us several hours to remove the emir from the palace,” a security personnel told Daily Trust on Monday.
