The police have arrested four armed robbery suspects who they alleged to be specialists in snatching exotic cars in Lagos and Abuja. The police said they trailed the suspects, whose operational base was said to be located at Agege, to a suspect who had bought a stolen car from them. Policemen described the buyer, whose operational base was said to be at Igbogbo, Ikorodu, Lagos, as a specialist in recycling stolen cars. The police said that on June 5, 2020, detectives attached to the State Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), acting on a tip-off, discovered a mechanic workshop where stolen cars were refurbished and later sold to unsuspecting buyers. The owner of the workshop was alleged to be the head of a car snatching gang. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, said yesterday that detectives sighted the gang after weeks of surveillance in Igbogbo robbing motorists and other unsuspecting victims of their valuables. “The team arrested one Solanke Kehinde and recovered an unregistered Toyota Camry saloon car 2010 model from him. During interrogation, he claimed that he bought the said car from a gang of armed robbers who live in the Agege area of Lagos. “He led the operatives to arrest three of the armed robbery suspects, namely, Wale Owoeye, 29; Samuel Akinlagun, 23, and Rashidi Ayoola, 28. “Items recovered from them included a cut-to- size double barrel gun with five live cartridges. The suspects will be charged to court after investigation is concluded,” he added.
