The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Abia State has called for the speedy prosecution of the former governor of the state, Senator Theodore Orji, over allegation of N525bn theft. The party expressed its joy and stated that the present EFCC probe was a huge blessing to Abians as it would help correct the false narratives consistently peddled by Abia State government and the lawmaker. The party, in a statement by its publicity secretary, Ebere Uzoukwa enjoined Abians to remain strong and vigilant as the EFCC continues with its investigation aimed at returning all looted Abia funds as well as bringing perpetrators of financial crimes against Abians to justice. APGA called on the former governor and his son, who is the current speaker, Abia House of Assembly, to step down from their legislative duties and face their matters in EFCC. 2019: APGA pledges free and fair primaries in Abia Orji Kalu hobnobbing with Abia gov â€“ APC chieftain God will install me as next Abia governor - Otti
