The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has explained why it fixed 5 December for the 15 by-elections in 11 states despite the absence of Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who is awaiting Senate confirmation for his second term in office. The INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), Festus Okoye, made the explanation on Tuesday in Abuja. “The commission decided to conduct the outstanding national and state assembly elections on December 5 because there is an improved security situation in the country and the National Youth Service Corps members have resumed their national service after the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. Okoye said Yakubu, before stepping aside and handing over to AVM Ahmed Mu’azu as acting chairman of the commission, charged the national commissioners not to allow the activities of the commission to be affected on account of his absence and the retirement of other national commissioners.
