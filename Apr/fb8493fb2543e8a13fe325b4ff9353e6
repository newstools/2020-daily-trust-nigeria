The Environmental Preservation, Development and Restoration International Organization (EPDRIO) has urged the FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, to include them in the fumigation and decontamination exercise against the COVID-19 in the territory. The President and Vice President of the association, Mr. Terungwa Abari and Samuel Odigie, respectively told journalists at the weekend in Abuja, that they are a private sector professional association of public health practitioners, pest controllers and fumigators who are duly registered in the FCT. Abari said that they were asked to mobilize for decontamination/disinfection of the FCT for the COVID-19 pandemic and are waiting to be called to play that role now. “After the flag-off exercise, presided over by the Minister of State for the FCT, we looked forward to being invited to commence the real decontamination/disinfection exercise, but this has not yet happened and time is of essence in this matter of COVID-19 global scourge,” he said. Abari also urged the FCT Minister to intervene in the guideline, asking their clients to pay for some jobs under the COVID-19 pandemic decontamination/disinfection ‘‘even when we are already registered with AMAC’’.
