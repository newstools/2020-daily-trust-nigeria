The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has constituted a committee to probe the conduct of the 2019 general elections to identify grey areas. Briefing newsmen yesterday at the end of the meeting that lasted several hours in Abuja, the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the committee, whose leader he declined to mention, would work closely with the Board of Trustees (BoT) and the National Working Committee (NWC) to actualise its mandate. He said the NEC resolved not to change the name of the party as sought by some stalwarts of the party, adding that PDP would rather strengthen its structures and rebuild to seize power in future elections. “The PDP has constituted a committee to review the 2019 elections. So those canvassing for change of name should be careful,” he said. He added that the NEC had charged the PDP lawmakers in the National Assembly to push for the review and amendment of the Electoral Act to pave way for free, fair and credible elections. Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) Senator Walid Jibrin, however, expressed worry over the defection of PDP members in the Imo State House of Assembly to the APC following the Supreme Court verdict. He also expressed disappointment over the defection of PDP chairman in Kano State, Alhaji Rabiu Suleiman Bichi, to APC. “I am also disappointed with the comments I read in the newspapers allegedly by a chieftain of our party of a plan to change the name of PDP. Please, count the BoT out of any effort to change the name of this party. We shall never allow it,” he said.
