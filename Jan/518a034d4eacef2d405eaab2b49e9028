Firadusi told journalists yesterday that on the day of her abduction, she had boarded a tricycle around Shagari low cost Housing unit where she lives and upon entering, one of the occupants pointed a knife at her while another one pointed a gun at her. “Immediately the driver veered off the main road as they blindfolded me.

Firdausi’s father, Malam Magaji said, her abductors had demanded for N2million but nothing was paid and thanked police for her rescue. Speaking about the incident, the spokesman of the state police command SP Gambo Isah, said “On 12 January, 2020, a gang of kidnappers operating in a commercial tricycle kidnapped a 22-year-old girl, Fridaus Magaji. The kidnappers demanded for two million naira as ransom from her parents to ensure her release. “Upon the receipt of information on the kidnap, our SARS team led by SP Adolphus Andrew swung into action and tracked the movements of the kidnappers. But the kidnappers were switching locations. On Wednesday, 15, January, 2020, about 10.30 p.m, the team traced the kidnappers and the girl to a place at Barawa area, an outskirt of Katsina.” “The team had a gun duel with the kidnappers who eventually ran away and left the girl behind. After our team rescued the girl, we took her to a hospital for medical attention. Thank God, the kidnappers did not hurt her.” he added ‎ Police rescue 75-year-old woman from kidnappers in Delta Police rescue abducted corps member in Lagos swamp States back in grip  of kidnappers, bandits
