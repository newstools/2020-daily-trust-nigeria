The North-East Development Commission (NEDC) is to launch a scholarship scheme for the children thrown out of school by violent conflict in the region. The scheme is to also accommodate children who attained school age during the conflict, but were deprived of the opportunity to access schooling. “We will soon launch a robust scholarship scheme to accommodate every child, both the children whose education was truncated by the conflict and those who could not start school due to the conflict,” the Managing Director of the Commission, Dr. Mohammed Goni Alkali, said yesterday in Maiduguri. “The scholarship scheme will provide for both children who want to take the academic line and those who want to acquire vocational skills,” the MD explained at the end of his tour of the Borno State Rehabilitation Center, which houses repentant Boko Haram insurgents and rescued captives. He said due to the importance it attaches to the resuscitation of education in the region the commission  would soon commence the execution of two projects for each local government area in all the states of the region, one of which would be in the education sector. The MD said the Commission would be “demand-driven” not “supply-driven” in its service to the region according to its mandate. Dr. Alkali described the repentance of perpetrators of violent conflict as a “tracking point” for the commission to enable it determine what it can do for them “in the short term and in the long term” to transform them to useful and law-abiding members of the society. He described the Maiduguri Rehabilitation Center as one of the critical stakeholders of the commission’s duties in the region.
