Osinbajo, in a goodwill message yesterday to congratulate the former governor of Lagos State on his 68th birthday, said his large and generous heart, political astuteness and uncommon intellect had become the stuff of legend. Osinbajo said: “Today we celebrate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a visionary, transformative leader and patriot. Your exceptional political career and service has inspired millions. It is true that few leaders have developed as many leaders from the ranks of their protégés as you have done. “Your incredibly large and generous heart, political astuteness and uncommon intellect have become the stuff of legend. “Today, but for COVID-19, we would, as we have done in the past twelve years, celebrated this day with the *Bola Tinubu Colloquium,* where we do what is your greatest passion, proffering answers to developmental questions. We will by God’s grace still do this and many more. “I pray for you sir, that as your days, so shall your strength, wisdom and favour be with God, in Jesus name.”  Lagos Speaker hails Tinubu on birthday, says he’s greatest politician of this generation Ambode hails Tinubu, says Nigeria on threshold of greatness Tribute to Tinubu at the Diamond Age
