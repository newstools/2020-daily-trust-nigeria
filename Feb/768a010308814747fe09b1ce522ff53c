The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has urged security personnel who drive against traffic during rush hours to obey all traffic rules as their status does not immune them from prosecution. Chairman of the Ministerial Task Team on Decongestion of Traffic in the FCT, Mr. Ikharo Attah, made this known during a presentation at a meeting with security agencies and other stakeholders in Abuja yesterday. He noted that most of the gridlocks experienced on major roads in the territory were caused by security men, and in some cases, trailer drivers who have consistently floated the ban on them plying the roads until 10 pm. Attah, who frowned at the attitude of the security personnel, stressed that nobody was immune from prosecution as far as the task team was concerned. He stated that civilian motorists often abide by the traffic rules on the highways but security agents violate traffic rules and regulations which most times cause traffic jams. The task team chairman also decried that some truck drivers have refused to obey a standing directive which has restricted them from moving their vehicles during the peak period, which, he noted has compounded the traffic situation along Abuja-Keffi road axis. Attah urged the meeting to come up with a blueprint on how to tackle perennial gridlocks on the Abuja-Keffi road axis, to reduce the unnecessary waste of lives and property, as well as man hours on the road.  ‘Security agents cause gridlock on Nyanya-Keffi road’ Task force cautions security agents against violation of traffic rules Enforcing motorcycle ban in Abuja
