President Muhammadu Buhari says Nigeria will ensure adequate resource allocation for research and development because of its recognition of the centrality of science and technology in the development process. Buhari said this yesterday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, while speaking at a breakfast meeting of the Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South organized by the president of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, in his capacity as chairperson. The president said at the meeting held on the margins of the 33rd AU Summit that technology was aiding Nigeria’s advancement in critical sectors of the economy. He said his administration was conscious of the relevance of science and technology in national development and as such has a ministry dedicated to the sector, which is headed by a scientist. “We are concentrating on encouraging our students, at the primary and post primary levels, to love and study more of science related subjects rather than arts, political science and history,” he also said in a statement yesterday by his media aide Garba Shehu. The Ghanaian president, in his remarks, said as an inter-governmental organization made up of 27 member states, COMSATS was playing a leading role in cultivating an enhanced culture of scientific and technological cooperation among member states.
