The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) says the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole has neutralized dozens of Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) at Bula Korege on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest in Borno State. It said the operation was in continuation of its Operation Decisive Edge. Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, in a statement, said the air strikes were conducted in two waves of attack on 6 March 2020 sequel to credible intelligence reports indicating that the BHTs had relocated some of their fighters to the settlement to reinforce the location preparatory for attacks on troops’ locations and surrounding civilian settlements. He said the ATF dispatched an enhanced force package of several attack aircraft and a surveillance platform to engage the location. Daramola added that overhead the target area, significant activity of the fighters was observed in different parts of the settlements. He said the NAF fighter jets took turns in attacking the target area, neutralizing many BHTs and destroying their structures in successive passes. He said after the first wave of strikes, the terrorists reassembled at another part of the settlement where they were tracked and mopped-up. Daramola said the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its air campaign against the terrorists’ hideouts to shape the battle space for the effective conduct of further ground and air operations.
