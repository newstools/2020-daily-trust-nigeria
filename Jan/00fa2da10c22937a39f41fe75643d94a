The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said yesterday that the return of stolen resources and sincere apologies for the havoc wrecked on the country during the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 16-year rule should be the preoccupation of leading opposition party. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said the ruling party offered the “new year counseling” to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, following what he called his own tongue-in-cheek advice to his party, the PDP, urging them to concentrate on strengthening and rebuilding the PDP for now, rather than dissipating energy on the 2023 elections. Issa-Onilu said the former PDP presidential candidate was anything but sincere in his advice. He, however, said that Atiku and the PDP represented the wasted past which Nigerians had chosen to discard and correct. “The era when national assets were a bazaar for cronies and friends; an era when funds were approved and released for projects that were never executed; an era of waste and impunity; an era of voodoo economy; an era when corruption was a state policy. “Nigerians now enjoy a new dispensation which has ensured massive infrastructural development covering the rail, road, agriculture, aviation, ports, education and health sectors. The resolute and pro-people intervention by the President Muhammadu Buhari government has ensured the plugging of revenue leakages, oil sector reforms, anti-corruption policies, economic diversification, rapid infrastructure development, intensification of fight against violent extremism among others. “Instead of Atiku focussing on how to corner the 2023 presidential ticket of the PDP or any of the other political parties where he may choose to purchase his ticket, we call on Atiku, along with other PDP leaders to find the courage to return our resources and seek forgiveness from Nigerians,” he said in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja.
