As the people prepare for the year 2020, some Bayelsans have outlined their expectations, especially from the incoming government in the state, under the leadership of Chief David Lyon, governor-elect for Bayelsa State. Mrs Nonso Peters, a fruit seller in Yenagoa, told Daily Trust that God had been fair and faithful to the State in 2019 and prepared a purposeful year for the people of the state in 2020 through the victory of Chief Lyon as the next governor come February 14. “As you look at our state, we don’t have adequate infrastructures compare to other states in Nigeria. Security is our big challenge. People cannot even walk freely on the roads. In our communities, epileptic power supply is prevalent in Bayelsa, that was the reason why while we were preparing for governorship election during the last quarter of 2019, we prayed that God should give us the people’s governor. And by God’s grace, Chief Lyon won. With him in as the governor, we know Bayelsans will experience accelerated development. “During his campaigns, he promised security, efficient health care delivery, provision of employments to our teaming youth, infrastructural renaissance, and we are hopeful that we will experience these things in 2020. The year will be a prosperous one for all Nigerians by God’s gracem,” she said.
