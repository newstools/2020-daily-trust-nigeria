The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has said the Federal Government generated $317.5 million from cocoa exports in 2019. Available statistics indicate that 45 per cent of cocoa produced in Nigeria is exported to the Netherlands, while Germany and Malaysia are ranked second and third in cocoa imports from Nigeria; importing 22 per cent and 6.2 per cent of Nigeria’s cocoa output respectively. The Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer (ED/CEO) of NEPC, Mr. Olusegun Awolowo, disclosed this in Abuja yesterday while receiving in his office the Belgian Ambassador to Nigeria, His Excellency, Mr. Daniel Dargent. Mr. Awolowo explained that for Nigeria and other major exporting countries of the commodity, such as Cote D’Ivoire and Ghana, to take a big chunk of the $82bn global cocoa/chocolate industry, there was need to attract investments in the area of capacity building and provision of cutting-edge equipment for processing and value addition. He expressed optimism that the bi-lateral trade relations between both countries would further provide Nigerian businessmen, especially Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs), and their Belgian counterparts the opportunity to maximise the huge benefits offered by the economies of both countries. The Belgian Ambassador, Mr. Dargent, said he was optimistic that Nigeria would sustain its effort at diversification of the economy and also pledged to support the effort of the council using the zero oil plan as a platform in providing the required expertise to build capacity for Nigerian exporters.  ‘Why Netherlands is Nigeria’s major trade partner in Europe’ Non-oil exports as Nigeria’s next line of defence Nigeria records rise in non-oil export
