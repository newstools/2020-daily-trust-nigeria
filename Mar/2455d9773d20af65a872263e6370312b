The Joint Health Sector Union says the special treatment for doctor is fuelling industrial disharmony in the health sector. JOHESU President, Joy Josiah, while addressing the House of Representatives Committee on Health Institutions, at public hearing in Abuja yesterday, said members of the union made up 95 percent of the workforce in the sector, but their income was nothing to write home compared to other countries. He alleged that the doctors, who represented only five percent of the workforce in the sector, had numerous privileges. Josiah complained that appointment as health minister or head of medical agencies had become the birth right of doctors. He blamed the alleged imbalance in the sector on the Teaching Hospital Degree 10 of 1985 under the regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. He also alleged that only doctors got trained and retrained; while other professionals were left out of developing their knowledge. According to him, other professionals are not allowed to head their departments; all departments are headed by doctors. The union recommended that appointments in the health sector should be made to reflect fairness. Earlier, the chairman of the committee, Pascal Obi (AA-Imo) said the committee would ensure health institutions functioned optimally to the benefit of all Nigerians.
