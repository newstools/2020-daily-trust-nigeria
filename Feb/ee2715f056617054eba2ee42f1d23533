Residents in some areas of Osun State, who had experienced power outage due to a fire outbreak at a transmission sub-station at Ayede on Wednesday, were excited yesterday as power was restored. A TCN 150 MVA,330/132/33kv power transformer had caught fire in the early hours of Wednesday. Power consumers in Iwo and Ejigbo expressed amazement with the swift response of the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC), saying they had feared months of outage after the fire incident. The fire was contained a few hours later but it threw many towns into darkness. Also affected were Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu and Iseyin in Ogun and Oyo states. Consumers lauded officials of the Transmission Company of Nigeria and IBEDC’s engineers for their prompt response in restoring bulk supply. The IBEDC Acting Chief Technical Officer, Engineer Felix Abiodun, said the affected transmission sub-station supplies power to a sizeable area of IBEDC’s franchise.
