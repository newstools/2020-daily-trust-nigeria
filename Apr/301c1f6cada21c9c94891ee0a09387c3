The Kumo East Ward of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe state says it has expelled a member representing Akko Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, Usman Bello Kumo, over alleged anti-party activities. The party leaders at his ward in Kumo East of Akko LGA, had in a letter dated April 1 addressed to the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, said the expulsion followed a petition against the federal lawmaker. According to the letter signed by the Chairman of APC in Kumo East ward, Musa Barade, it said the ward executive committee arrived at the decision after receiving the petition and report of a seven-man fact-finding committee to investigate the allegations leveled against the lawmaker. However, in a swift reaction, the ward Secretary of the party, Shuaibu Adamu led other 19 executive members to distance themselves from the said dismissal of Bello Kumo from the party. Addressing newsmen on Thursday at the APC state secretariat, Adamu said their signatures were forged by the ward chairman in the said letter expelling Kumo from the party. The ward secretary said the accusations against Usman Bello Kumo are false, and also denied the said constitution of a seven-man fact-finding committee. The ward leaders also suspended Musa Barade as APC chairman of Kumo East ward for six months with effect from April 2.
