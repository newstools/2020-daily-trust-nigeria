The Chief of Judge of Ogun State, Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, yesterday challenged the newly appointed chief and senior Magistrates in the state to resist the temptation of abusing judicial powers in the course of dispensing justice. Dipeolu gave the charge yesterday at the Judiciary Complex, Kobape Road, Abeokuta, while administering the oath of office on six newly appointed chief and senior magistrates in the Ogun State judiciary. She enjoined the magistrates to be diligent, time-conscious, reliable, honest and humane in their dealings with citizens and litigants. “Judicial officers have a constitutional duty to serve this nation competently, diligently, fairly, professionally and speedily. Judicial officers are public servants whose salaries and other entitlements are paid by this nation and judicial independence goes hand-in-hand with accountability,” she said. The Chief Judge reminded the promoted magistrates that they were subject to criticisms as it would be through this that they would able to correct their faults and shortcomings. “Indeed, our conduct must be professional and above reproach at all times. Judicial officers must earn the trust, respect and confidence of the people they serve,” she added. Those appointed as chief magistrates are Mr Awofeso Ireti-Olu Babatunde, Mr Dipeolu Dehinde and Mrs Osinbajo Moriyike Oluwabunmi, while Mr Adekunle Shodeinde, Mrs Kolawole Ogunbowale and Mr Solana Shodeinde were appointed senior magistrates Ogun swears in new magistrates No rapist will go unpunished in Ogun – CJ Lagos New CJ vows to stamp out corruption
