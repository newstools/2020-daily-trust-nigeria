A group of concerned Peoples Democratic Party stakeholders’ forum in Katsina has called on the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to within one week constitute a caretaker committee to take over the current leadership of the party. The spokesman of the group Abdulaziz Halliru Kafin Soli, while briefing newsmen at the end of the forum’s meeting said the caretaker committee should then be given six months within which to reconcile all members who have been maligned by the current leadership of the party. According to him, the caretaker committee will then conduct credible congresses for election of new leadership of the party in the state. When contacted, the party chairman, Salisu Majigiri, said the protesting group was alien to the party and not an official group, and declined further comment.
