Oil prices on Tuesday rose marginally following China’s reported strong manufacturing data and President Donald Trump’s parley with Russia about efforts to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and stabilize the crude market. Specifically yesterday, online reports by marketwatch.com, indicated that West Texas Intermediate crude gained 37 cents, or 1.8%, to peak at $20.46/b, after briefly dipping below the psychologically important $20/b level a day earlier. The May contract however slumped 6.6% to settle at $20.09/b on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The global benchmark and Nigeria’s export crude, May Brent crude price rose by 8 cents, or 0.4%, at $22.84/b, after recording 8.7% slump on Monday to ebb at $22.76/b on ICE Futures Europe. It would be recalled that crude prices had fallen to the lowest level since 2002 on Monday, amid a demand slump associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and a glut of supply in the international market linked to the Russia-Saudi oil-price war. On Monday, WTI marked its lowest finish since February 2002, while Brent saw its lowest settlement since November of that year, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The rebound Tuesday came even as U.S. benchmark stock indexes moved lower. Wall Street equities had seen an upbeat session on Monday, driven by health-care stocks and hopes for a vaccine. Agency reports quoted senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, Ipek Ozkardeskaya, in a note to clients, as saying that “a joint action from oil producer countries to lower production could encourage a certain recovery in oil prices,” adding that “any supply-side intervention should be sizable to match the historical decline in demand.” Brent crude rises $1, but set for first yearly drop since 2015 Oil prices drop as traders wait for G20, OPEC+ meetings Oil nears $50/b over shale slowdown, OPEC stand
