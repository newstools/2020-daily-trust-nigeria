The police in Lagos have filed criminal charges before a Botanical Gardens, Ebute Meta, chief magistrate court against a 45-year-old man who allegedly issued a dud cheque. The accused person, Eigbafoh Paul Smith, and others still on the run were alleged to have conspired to obtain money under false pretence and issued the dud cheque. The police from the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Panti, Yaba, said that the offence was committed in August last year in Ikeja, Lagos. It was also alleged that the accused person used his UBA account No. 1017739637 to obtain N5 million from the First Pioneer Co-operative Multipurpose Service Limited, with the pretence he would pay back, a representation he allegedly knew to be false. According to the police, Smith, on December 11, 2019, issued three different UBA cheques amounting to N6.6m in favour of First Pioneer Co-operative Multipurpose Service Limited which, when presented, were dishonoured due to insufficient funds in his credit account. Smith pleaded not guilty and was admitted to N500,000 bail with two sureties. Chief Magistrate A. Adedayo has fixed further hearing for March 30, 2020.
