Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong yesterday solicited the Federal Government’s support in empowering internally displaced persons in the state and reintegrating them into society. He spoke yesterday when he led a delegation of the state government to the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq. “This visit is important because, in the last few years, we had a lot of crisis in Plateau state. We did our best to curb the crisis, which led to the creation of many IDPs camps in different parts of the state. “Fortunately, the crisis is over, but we can’t say we have peace with many of our people still in different IDPs camps across the state. After winning my election at the Supreme Court, we are focused now,” Lalong said. Responding, the minister expressed her ministry’s readiness to work with the state government on different humanitarian issues.
