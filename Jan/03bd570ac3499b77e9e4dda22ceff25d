Erstwhile governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha will apply for the review of the Supreme Court judgment which recently sacked him from office. The apex court had declared Senator Hope Uzodinma of the APC winner of the governorship poll. One of the senior aides to the sacked governor confirmed to our reporter that his boss would be seeking the review of the verdict today. “He is making the move and will most likely go to the Supreme Court tomorrow (Monday), but we need to confirm that,” the aide said. Also, the leader of the Abuja Discussion Group, Dr Manzo Abubakar on Sunday during a briefing with organised by a coalition of 17 civil society organisations, disclosed that Ihedioha will be seeking a review of the judgment on Monday He said the judgment contains a lot gaps which the Supreme Court will need to review. He said the apex court delivered a full judgment on January 14 and did not give any date for reasons, adding that the judgment delivered in open court only considered evidence of Rabi’u Hussein, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, but the text now included other witnesses such as PW12 to PW34, PW11 and PW51. “It is unprecedented for Supreme Court to manipulate or doctor its own judgement to cover its tracks,” he said. He explained that although Uzodinma claimed his results from 388 polling units were excluded, but the DCP admitted at the tribunal that he could only produce 366 result sheets in form EC8As. “The Supreme Court credited him with votes he did not plead,” he said.
