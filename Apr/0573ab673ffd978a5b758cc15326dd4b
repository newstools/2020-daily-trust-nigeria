The Ondo State governor, Atakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has ordered the fumigation of all markets and motor parks across the state to curtail the spread of COVID – 19 in the state. Akeredolu said in Akure on Tuesday that the Committee on Sanitation and Traffic Rules would be carrying out the exercise. “We have given additional responsibility to the committee to disinfect and fumigate our markets, streets and motor parks. The state government has purchased motorised water pumps. We have 50 drums of ethanol and chlorine that would be used for this exercise. “We have equally bought water takers and Hilux vans that will carry the water tankers to the markets and motor parks. By the time our markets return to trading activities after the closure, they will be clean markets that had been fumigated,’’ he said. Responding, the Chairman of the committee, who is the state’s Commissioner for Water Resources, Mrs Yetunde Adeyanju, said the exercise would commence immediately in all the markets in towns and motor parks across the state. According to Adeyanju, the committee would recruit over 100 ad hoc staff from across the three senatorial districts in the state for the job.
