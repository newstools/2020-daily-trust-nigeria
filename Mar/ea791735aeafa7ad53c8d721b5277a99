The Lagos State Yellow Taxi and Eko Cab Drivers Association has introduced a digital mobile app, called the Eko Cab App, to enhance the operational efficiency of its members. It was gathered that the association launched the app in response to the declining patronage of the yellow taxi cab, following the advent of several digital transportation apps in the state. The Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, who spoke during the launch, advised members of the association to comply with the extant laws and stipulated regulations to ensure success and sustainability of the initiative. Represented by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mr Oluseyi Whenu, Olaseinde urged the commercial vehicle operators to leverage digital technology to bring innovation into their business. “The state government is not out to punish anyone. As you go digital today, you are expected to be more civil and friendly with your customers than before, while you are expected to operate in line with the extant laws and regulations that guide public transportation in the state,” he said. The association’s General Secretary, Mr Taiwo Omolekan, said the launch would enable the body bridge the gap created by the restriction of commercial motorcycle and tricycle operation in some parts of the state.
