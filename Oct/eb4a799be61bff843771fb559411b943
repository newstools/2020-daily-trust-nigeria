A group under the name North-west All Progressives Social Media Forum has alleged that unpatriotic politicians are behind the EndSARS protests in the country. The group cautioned youths across the country not to allow bad politicians to instigate them against the government for their selfish interests. The forum’s chairman, Ahmed Rufa’i Gumel, who stated while addressing newsmen in Kaduna, said the plan by politicians sponsoring the protests was to create mayhem and unrest in the country. “We also believe that their intent is to use this protest to spark an uprising in the country to divert attention from critical issues that might arise in 2023. All in their bid to cast hatred on President Muhammadu Buhari,” he said.
