A seven-year-old marriage between Mr Femi Williams and his wife, Kemi, has been dissolved by an Ado-Ekiti Customary court. Kemi, 32, who had petitioned the court to end her marriage to Femi, had given her evidence before its president, Mrs Olayinka Akomolede, on October 29, 2019, while her husband was absent throughout proceedings on the matter. The court dissolved the marriage on grounds of Femi’s desertion of the matrimonial home for three years, maltreatment of his wife at the slightest misunderstanding and lack of care for the only child of the marriage. Kemi, a resident of No. 21, Oke-Ila Street, Ado-Ekiti, informed the court that she and her husband stopped living together in 2017 when he left their matrimonial home allegedly on the advice of his mother. According to her, Femi’s mother came to remove his belongings from the house thereafter and, barely two months after that, the old woman brought policemen to arrest her on the allegation that it was she (Kemi) who had stolen those belongings. Kemi explained that the police took away some of her own belongings, including a gas cooker and a television, allegedly on her husband’s order. She prayed the court to order the respondent to take up the responsibility of taking care of their son, Daniel, a four-year-old boy. Mrs Akomolede dissolved the marriage, saying it had broken down irretrievably, especially as the respondent had consistently shunned the court’s invitations. She ruled that the custody of the child be awarded to the petitioner, while the respondent shall be paying N5,000 monthly as feeding allowance for the child. The president also granted Kemi’s prayer for an order from the court to retrieve her belongings from police custody.
