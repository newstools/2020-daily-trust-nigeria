The newly elected chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State, Mr Solomon Agwanana, has promised to make deliberate effort to reconcile and re-integrate aggrieved members within and outside the party. Agwanana, while speaking after being declared the winner of the delegates’ election by the Senator James Manager-led PDP national congress committee yesterday in Yenagoa, expressed appreciation to the delegates, Governor Douye Diri and other leaders for giving him and his team the opportunity to serve the party. Earlier, Governor Diri, who is the leader of the party in the state, had expressed optimism that PDP would win the suspended Bayelsa Central and West senatorial by-elections whenever they are conducted. He said the peaceful conduct of the PDP ward, LG and state congresses demonstrated the party’s maturity and dominance in the state.
