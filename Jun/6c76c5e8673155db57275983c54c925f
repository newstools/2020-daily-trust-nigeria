The APC in Ekiti State has asked the opposition PDP to account for the over N10 billion allegedly earmarked for a cargo airport in the state during the administration of Governor Ayo Fayose. The APC, in a statement yesterday in Ado Ekiti, said the PDP or any of its members had no moral right to comment on the ongoing cargo airport project currently being executed by the APC-controlled administration. The PDP, through its state Caretaker Committee Chairman, Prince Diran Odeyemi, alleged that the airport was a ploy by Governor Kayode Fayemi “to take away the money of Ekiti to contest the presidential election, saying the airport project was “an avenue for corruption”. Odeyemi said: “Of what importance is the airport project to an average Ekiti man. Compare it to the bridge built by former Governor Ayo Fayose in the state capital. People are benefiting from the bridge.” Dear our valued reader, we would like to hear your view about a membership club that we plan to launch. Kindly help us fill this survey. Condemning the PDP statement, the state Director of Media and Publicity of APC, Mr.  Sam Oluwalana, explained that the criticism from the opposition PDP was only reminding the people of the state of the chains of dirty deals and sufferings unleashed on them by the immediate past administration of Mr. Ayo Fayose. Mr. Oluwalana said, “This was an administration that earmarked over N10bn for the cargo airport and nothing to show for tax payers’ money. “At the inception of the present administration of Dr. Kayode Fayemi, nothing concrete or visible was found at the project site despite the huge amount of money earmarked for it and approved by the House of Assembly.”  APC, PDP bicker over N11bn Benue airport project Why APC is opposed to Ekiti airport project – PDP APC, PDP in fight to finish over Ekiti
