The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, has challenged Project Development Institute (PRODA) in Enugu, Enugu State, to assist in diversifying Nigeria’s economy through intensive research outputs. Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu made the call when he commissioned the induction furnace and school pencil projects at the institute recently. Dr Onu said: “I want PRODA to be a center of excellence in many areas and contribute its quota to the economic diversification drive of the Federal Government.” He expressed satisfaction with the progress made by PRODA on induction furnace, adding that it would be useful in production of non-ferrous aluminum and stainless steel which are of multiple benefits to the Industrial sector. The minister also commended the Institute for the progress made in graphite which he described as a new material that can be used in many industries, including the petroleum sector. On the commercialization of research findings, Dr. Onu said a committee had already been set up on it, adding that research institutes cannot carry out research and commercialize same. The private sector, he added, would be encouraged to commercialize research endeavors and turn them into products and services. Dr. Onu further said the yearly Science and Technology EXPO was instituted to bring together researchers, innovators and investors for the purpose of commercialization. The minister said he was satisfied with the progress in the number of patents in the country, adding that from mere 6 in 2015, the number has now jumped to 57 today. In his speech, the Director General of PRODA, Dr. Charles Agulana praised the minister for heralding innovative and impactful research and development to the institutes and the Ministry in general.
