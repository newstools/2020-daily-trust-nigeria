She just came back from Germany where she went for a checkup and the doctors said all was well. “Unfortunately, in the last two weeks, her health deteriorated, she could not use her limbs and she was in so much pain. I pray Allah admit her into Jannatul Firdausi because she accepted Islam 10 years ago and even though she did not really tell anyone apart from her close family, she practiced the religion in her own little way.” He said her funeral prayer will be conducted at the Sultan Bello mosque at 1pm,while the interment will take place at the Isa Kaita road Muslim Cemetery. She is survived by her husband, Alhaji Sani Ibrahim, her sisters, her two children Bashiru Sani and Zainab Kana as well as six grandchildren.
