Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko yesterday said the recent Supreme Court verdict on Sokoto governorship will not in any way weaken the support base of the All Progressives Congress in the state. The verdict had reaffirmed the victory of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and dismissed the appeal by the APC and its candidate, Ahmad Aliyu. Overwhelmed by the large crowd of APC supporters that received him and the Minister of Police at the Sultan Abubakar III International Airport, the erstwhile governor of the state, however succumbed to fate, saying the verdict was the will of God. He said they had taken it in good faith despite the fact that the verdict was surprising to them in view of the factual evidences tendered before the court. Wamakko, who spent hours before reaching his Gawon Nama’s residence, ordinarily a 15-minute drive from the airport, expressed gratitude to God.  He urged APC supporters to remain peaceful and law abiding. He called on them to come out en masse and vote for their candidates in next Saturday’s rerun elections in the state. “APC is a peaceful party and its members are known to be peaceful and law abiding. We don’t insult, we don’t make inflammatory statement. So I urge you to remain peaceful and work for the success of the party,” he said. In his remarks, Minister of Police Affairs Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi said they were shocked by the verdict but that they had left everything to God. The governorship candidate of the party in the last election, Ahmad Aliyu, said the verdict had endeared them more to the people of the state who were eager for change.
