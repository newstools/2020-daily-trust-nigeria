The International Press Institute (IPI) has expressed concern on worsening state of press freedom around the world with the spread of the COVID-19, as governments both autocratic and democratic are increasingly clamping down on the media. This even as the institute complained that 53 journalists around the world were killed in connection with their work in the last one year. According to an IPI special report to mark the World Press Freedom Day 2020, in democratic as well as autocratic states, the public health crisis has allowed governments to exercise control over the media on the pretext of preventing the spread of disinformation. IPI Executive Director, Barbara Trionfi said, the data collected by IPI illustrated the risk  which in some places was already the reality, that states would take advantage of the health crisis to control media messages, in full disregard of the public’s need for independent information.
