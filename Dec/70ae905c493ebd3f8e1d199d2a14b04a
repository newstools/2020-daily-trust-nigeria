A former Governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Sule Lamido, has said the calls for the impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over his leadership inadequacies would not receive his support. Lamido, while speaking to newsmen after the inauguration of the recently elected PDP chairmen in 27 local government areas (LGAs) of his state, said the calls were rather a vindication of his long-held view of the president’s capacity. The former governor, who insisted that he had nothing personal against the president, added that his criticisms were based on his political background of speaking the truth to those in power. The ex-governor, who spoke on a variety of national issues, including his aspiration, also expressed belief that the time was not ripe for such aspiration. He added that what PDP required now was stability and cohesion.
