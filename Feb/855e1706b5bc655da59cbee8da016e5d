One week after he was sworn-in as governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri yesterday approved the appointment of four principal officers for his administration. His Acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, who disclosed this in a press release, said the new appointees include a former Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Friday Konbowei Benson, who will serve as Secretary to the State Government, Chief Benson Agadaga as Chief of Staff, Peter Pereotubo Akpe as Deputy Chief of Staff and Mr. Irorodamie Komonibo as Principal Secretary. The appointments are with immediate effect. Meanwhile, politicians in the state are said to be scrambling for positions in Governor Diri’s government, with some said to be using Dickson to secure appointment. Diri, at a thanksgiving service on Sunday, expressed readiness to form an all-inclusive government in the state where even members of opposition parties will be given appointments in his government. A source at the government house told Daily Trust that what delaying appointments by the governor to key positions in his government were inputs from Dickson and his party, PDP. He said the former governor who brought Diri to power, will contribute the greater percentage of the appointees, the same thing with the PDP leadership.
