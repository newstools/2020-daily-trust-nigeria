Crisis has erupted in the camp of Ibadan family heads, otherwise known as Authentic Mogajis, over a factional endorsement of Mukaila Lamidi, popularly called Auxiliary, as chairman of the motor park managers that the governor of Oyo State, Engineer Seyi Makinde, recently appointed. A faction of the heads, led by Mogaji Wale Oladoja, had last week visited Auxiliary to express support for the government and the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the state. But another faction, led by Mogaji Abdeljelili Adanla, kicked against the visit and support, saying it was not part of the group supporting the appointment of Auxiliary as leader of the NURTW in the state. Oladoja, at a press conference in Ibadan yesterday, however, declared he headed the authentic faction of the family heads, saying he had the mandate and letter from the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, to form the Authentic Mogaji of Ibadanland. He stated that some people parading themselves as leaders of the group had been suspended, adding that according to a letter from the Olubadan palace, the names of the new executive members of the real Authentic Mogajis were expected to emerge this week when the necessary documents with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) had been perfected. He said the group was formed to support the cause of the Olubadan of Ibadanland during his face-off with the Oyo State government.
