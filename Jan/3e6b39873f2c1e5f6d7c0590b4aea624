The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors’ Forum and the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party have commended the Supreme Court for upholding the elections of governors Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Samuel Ortom (Benue) and Ahmed Fintiri (Adamawa). They however appealed to the Supreme Court to review and reverse its judgement on Imo governorship election which sacked Emeka Ihedioha as governor elected on its platform and declared candidate of the APC in the 2019 governorship election, Hope Uzodinma, as winner. The NWC in a statement yesterday by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the judgment on the four states would not in any way sway it to abandon or diminish the nationwide agitation for a judicial review and reversal of the verdict on Imo. “The party notes that by upholding the Sokoto, Bauchi, Benue and Adamawa elections, the Supreme Court has shown that it can still be trusted to assert its independence and can further redeem its image by immediately reversing its defective and widely condemned judgment on Imo State,” the NWC said. The PDP Governors’ Forum in a statement yesterday by its Director General, Earl Osaro Onaiwu, also congratulated four of its members on their victory at the Supreme Court. The governors said the apex court has by its judgments affirmed the wishes of the people who not only voted but defended their votes and the mandates they granted the governors during the gubernatorial election of March 2019. ”These are leaders who perfectly fit into the category of selfless politicians and deserve the people’s supports to excel,” the forum said.
