As uncertainties mount over the likely negative impact of the 5G technology deployment on lives and the environment, the Federal Government on Monday insisted it had yet to issue licence to any telecom operator to roll out 5G technology in the country. The government made this clarification in a statement issued by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). It stated that so far, it only approved test trial for the new technology, but had yet to approve its deployment. The commission’s  Executive Vice Chairman, Professor Umar Garba Danbatta, said that the “NCC back in November 2019 approved trial test for 5G for a period of three (3) months and that the trial has been concluded and installation decommissioned.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
