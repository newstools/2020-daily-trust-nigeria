Residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), especially young people,  have been urged to care for the elderly as a means of honouring people that cared for them. The pioneer of a humanitarian elderly care home, Titilayo Olatunji, who made this call at the commissioning of the home in Abuja, at the weekend said, elderly people need a sense of belonging regardless of their age. She said it was sad that aged people are ignored by society. “If we do not take care of the elderly, we can never grow. Because, in social development, the aged and young people are the most important, because they do not have the strength of their youth and cannot do anything again, they are just like babies. So, they are supposed to be taken care of by the society,” she said. The National Project Coordinator of Healthcare Packages for Improving the Quality of Care of the Elderly Population in Nigeria (IPC Project), Dr. Saidu Ahmed said the World Health Organisation (WHO) is trying to pull all the global challenges of the elderly and ensure they are solved. “The elderly are facing neglect, abandonment, poverty, lack of social protection and lack of long time care and all that, but with the plans the government is making, I believe that all those challenges will be taken care of,” Dr. Ahmed said.
