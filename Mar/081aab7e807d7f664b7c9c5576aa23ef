Governor John Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State is not nursing a presidential ambition, his Senior Special Assistant on Public Communication, Segun Dipe, has said. He said such claim was a fallacy and a misrepresentation of Fayemi’s personality and conduct. He pointed out that those who were spreading such rumour must have been studying Fayemi from afar and misread his relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari, thus taking his reconciliatory efforts for an ambition-driven one. According to Dipe, while Fayemi could be seen as eminently qualified and a sellable personality from the South West, he would rather prefer his intention to be understood as playing a crucial role of bridge-building among the state governors whose forum he chairs at present, and not of any subterranean move towards 2023. “Fayemi is a sitting governor and he chairs the Nigeria Governors’ Forum. He enjoys these roles and he is playing them to the best of his ability. “His objective is that of engaging in processes such as negotiation, mediation, conciliation and arbitration in order to move a seemingly violent conflict into non-violent dialogue, where differences are settled through conflict transformation processes or through the work of representative political institutions,” he said.
