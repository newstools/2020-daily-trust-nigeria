The chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, last night met with the national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in Lagos. The meeting, a source told our correspondent, was in continuation of the peace and reconciliation drive of the committee. The committee, which was constituted following the crises rocking the ruling party, had earlier met with Chief Bisi Akande, a former interim chairman of the party and close political ally of Tinubu at his Ila-Orangun country home in Osun State. “We are meeting with Asiwaju in furtherance of our committee’s peace trips,” the source said. Buni, the source said, was accompanied to the meeting by two governors; Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi) and Abubakar Bello (Niger). The secretary of the caretaker committee, Sen. John Akpan, was also with them. The meeting, our correspondent reports was still ongoing as at the time this story was filed last night. Earlier yesterday, in an interview after meeting with the committee, Chief Akande said his faith in the APC had been renewed with the calibre of members in the Buni-led committee. He urged the committee to differentiate true party men from platform seekers for the party to grow. “There is great hope in what l have seen in this committee; the party will certainly bounce back stronger,” he said. For his part, Buni said, “This meeting further gives the committee a lot of confidence towards a very successful exercise.”  APC caretaker committee visits Tinubu Our visit to Tinubu, Akande yielded positive result – Buni APC crisis rages on despite truce
