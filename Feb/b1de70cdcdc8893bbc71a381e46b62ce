Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has asked the Supreme Court to dismiss an application filed by former governor of the state, Emeka Ihedioha, challenging the January 14 judgment which removed him from office. Ihedioha and PDP had in an application dated February 5, 2020, and brought through his counsel and former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Kanu Agabi (SAN), asked the apex court to set aside its judgement, contending that the court erred in arriving at its decision to nullify the March 9, 2019 election and declare Uzodinma winner of the election after he presented excluded results from 388 polling units. In a preliminary objection by his counsel, Damian Dodo (SAN), Uzodinma is contending that having ruled on the matter, the Supreme Court has become functus officio “and divested of jurisdiction over the same matter.” He said the application “constitutes an invitation to the Supreme Court to sit on appeal over its final decision.” He added that the application “constitutes an abuse of court process” and “is against public policy.” “The appIication being a proceeding relating to or arising from election of a governor is barred by effluxion of time,” he said. Meanwhile, the Alliance of Civil Societies has called for a new panel to sit on the application by Ihedioha challenging the Supreme Court’s judgment. In a statement yesterday signed by Igho Akeregha, Livinus Ibiang and Ugochuckwu Hanks-Ezekiel Esq, the alliance asked the apex court to give clarity to Nigerians “as to what happened to the votes of the PDP and other parties in the 388 units tendered by the APC and its candidate.”  5 new issues as Ihedioha returns to S’Court Imo Guber: Supreme Court set date to hear Ihedioha's fresh application Why Supreme Court sacked PDP's Ihedioha, declared APC's Uzodinma as Imo governor
