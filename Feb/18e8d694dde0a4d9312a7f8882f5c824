The state counsel, Mrs Arinola Momoh-Ayokanbi, told the court that the defendant committed the offences between June 2018 and January 2019 in his residence at No. 11, Itumaro Street, Igbobo, Ikorodu, Lagos. The prosecution alleged that Adelana lured the boys with cash gifts before perpetrating the sexual assault by having anal sex with them.
