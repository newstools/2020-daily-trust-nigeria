Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has dedicated his victory to God, saying that it is for the people of Imo. The Supreme Court had on Tuesday thrown away the application of former Governor Emeka Ihedioha, where he asked the court to reverse its January 14 judgment, which sacked him as the governor of the state. The court held that it lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the case as its January 14 judgment is final and irreversible. Speaking in Owerri, the governor asked all the people of the state to rally round him for the progress of the state. Uzodinma extended his hands of fellowship to every Imolite, saying that the state is for everybody.
