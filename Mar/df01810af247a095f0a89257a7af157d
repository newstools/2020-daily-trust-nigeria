Nasarawa State Government has announced plans to cut down the cost of governance by 60 percent as from next month. The Deputy Governor  and chairman of  the committee set up by the state government to study the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic on the state’s economy, Dr. Emmanuel Akabe, gave this hint last Thursday. The Deputy Governor, at a media briefing in Lafia, said after careful study by the budget sub-committee on COVID-19, government resolved to cut down the cost of governance by 60 percent with effect from April 2020 based on the impact of the pandemic on the state’s economy. The Chairman pointed out looking at the economy and its impact on the state, it has become necessary for Nasarawa to look inward, by cutting down its budget, expenses and expenditure of government by over 60 percent. While noting that the Nigerian budget is based on a $50 per barrel, with crude oil price now below $30 per barrel, Dr. Akabe said that compelled the Federal Government to constitute a committee to look into the national budget, with the committee now working on a $30 per barrel budget. “It’s a hard time and that this is the truth. We must cut down cost of governance by up to 60 percent if Nasarawa State must survive,” he stated.
