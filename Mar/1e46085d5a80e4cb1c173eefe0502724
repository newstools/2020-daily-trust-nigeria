Thirty-two pharmacies and patent medicine stores have been shut by the Lagos State Taskforce on Counterfeit, Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Food for offences bordering on illegal operation and operating beyond scope of practice. The Commissioner for Health, Professor Akin Abayomi, said this yesterday after reviewing the report of the first enforcement exercise carried out by the ministry’s Pharmaceutical Inspectorate Unit for year 2020. Abayomi noted that the sealing was in accordance with the provisions of Section C34 of the Counterfeit, Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Foods Miscellaneous Provision Act of 1999. According to him, the affected premises included those located in Dopemu, Mangoro, Cement, Oniwaya, Ayobo-Ipaja, OrileAgege, Akinogun, Mosan and Ikola axes of Agege and Alimosho local government areas of the state. Abayomi explained that the affected pharmacies and patent medicine shops were sealed for offences that included operation without licence, engaging unqualified persons to man and dispense drugs to unsuspecting citizens, operating beyond scope through sale of ethical products, and displaying and storing drugs in unconducive environments that compromise the potency of the drugs, thereby rendering them ineffective. The Director, Pharmaceutical Services, Lagos State Ministry of Health, Dr Moyosore Adejumo, added, “This closure is thus part of the government’s renewed efforts to sanitize the drug distribution system and curb proliferation of fake drugs in the state.”  Lagos shuts 52 substandard pharmacies, patent medicine stores Group solicits for funds, equipment to fight crime Illegal pharmaceutical shops shut in Lagos rises to 27
