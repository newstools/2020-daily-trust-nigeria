The Minister of the FCT, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has urged Christians to use the occasion of the celebration of Easter to pray for the end of COVID 19 pandemic which has so far claimed thousands of lives across the world. The minister said history has shown that when people turn to God in true supplication, in times of distress, the Almighty indeed answers prayers. According to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, Easter as one of the holiest celebrations for Christians provides a great opportunity to pray to God to heal the sick and prevent further spread of  the disease. “I urge you to use this season    to reflect on the significance of the FCT as the centre of unity of our country. This is the season to show true neighborliness and reach out to the needy and the less privileged who have been impacted negatively by COVID 19. “The disease is such that it does not discriminate between the haves and the haves not and is no respecter of age or religious beliefs. We must therefore come together as communities to fight it together,” the minister was quoted in the statement. Malam Bello once again wished residents happy Easter celebrations and encouraged them to enjoy the festivities in the safety of their homes. ‘How we intend to celebrate Easter amidst lockdown’ Easter: FG declares Friday, Monday public holidays Easter: FG declares Friday, Monday public holidays
