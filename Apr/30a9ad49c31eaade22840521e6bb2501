Controversy has continued to trail the rice distribution by Osun State to residents to mitigate hardship during the lockdown imposed by the state government. The state government had distributed 6,020 bags to the people across the state expectedly to be shared two bags each to the over 3,000 polling units in the state. But many residents said the rice didn’t get to their areas, while some of those that got it said it had expired. A resident of Osogbo, who preferred anonymity, said he received “expired rice that had overstayed in the store.” A lady, who simply identified herself as Ajoke, said, “Not only did the rice not go round despite that they gave each person three milk tins, it is expired rice.” Reacting to the development, the state government said it has commenced investigation into the expired rice claim and vowed to punish any of the suppliers found culpable. The State Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs Funke Egbemode, said the state government was shocked by the development and had begun investigation into the matter. Egbemode said, “The state government is particularly pained by this development, considering the fact that it has never compromised quality in its provision of economic stimulus for the people of Osun in spite of its limited resources. “Upon receipt of the complaints, the state government immediately began investigations to establish the source of the few bags that appear not to have met the quality expected”.
