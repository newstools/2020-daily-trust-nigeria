Criminal gangs who are into smuggling of rice and poultry products have been advised to stay clear of Seme-Krake border in Lagos or will be made to face the wrath of the law when arrested. Acting Customs Area Controller, Seme Area Command, Deputy Comptroller Chedi Dalha Wada, who gave this warning at a brief handing over ceremony, yesterday,  said that the ban on the importation of rice and frozen poultry products was still in place. Wada also warned smugglers of vehicles to also desist from using Seme border as transit route, saying that any vehicle intercepted by officers of the command would be forfeited to government. The new controller promised to remain resolute in effectively discharging the core mandate of the service. He solicited the support and cooperation of the officers and men of the command, stakeholders and sister security agencies to achieve the service mandate. He said: “It is only with your cooperation and support that I will be able to effectively manage the affairs of the command towards suppression of smuggling to the barest minimum, maximum revenue collections and facilitation of trade. “I pledge to consolidate and improve on the achievements of my predecessor for effective service delivery,” he said. In a brief remark, the out-gone  controller, Mohammed Uba Garba wished the new controller a successful tenure and advised him to remain firm and resolute in decision making so as to effectively discharge the new responsibility bestowed upon him. He also prayed for God’s guidance and intervention throughout his tenure.
