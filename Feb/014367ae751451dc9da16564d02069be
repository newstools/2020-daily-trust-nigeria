Seven Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have petitioned the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) over some controversial bills in the National Assembly, which they said were meant to gag Nigerians. The CSOs, Amnesty International, Nigeria; Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD), Girl Child Africa, Enough is Enough, Say No Campaign Nigeria (SNC-Nigeria), Spaces for Change and YIAGA Africa, raised the alarm on Wednesday in Abuja in a petition they jointly signed. In the petition, the groups listed the bills as “Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill (‘Social Media Bill’)”, Independent National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speeches Bill (‘Hate Speech Bill’), and Civil Society Regulatory Commission Bill (‘NGO Bill’).
