The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has assured residents of the territory that there will be transparency in the distribution of palliatives to vulnerable households, especially in rural communities. The Director, Department of Monitoring and Inspection, Olawale Labiyi, made the statement during a meeting to brief staff of the department mandated to monitor the distribution of the items in the area councils. A statement by Josephine Mudashiru, public relations officer of the department, said the FCT administration would ensure accountability and transparency in the distribution process. Labiyi urged the monitoring and inspection teams to be accurate in taking stock of what is on the ground with date and time, and ensure that what is meant for each area council is delivered to it. The director added that there were other monitoring teams, including the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the League of Imams, civil societies/non-governmental organisations and others. “You may wish to recall that the minister of state has held meetings with area council chairmen and traditional rulers for a successful exercise,” the statement read in part. Meanwhile, a private enterprise, 4U Supermarket, has donated palliatives to the FCT Administration for distribution to the poor and vulnerable in the territory. The donations by 4U Supermarket, formerly known as Amigo Supermarket, were made on Wednesday by Barrister Hadiza Aliyu on behalf of the enterprise. The items donated included rice, noodles, spaghetti, sugar and milk among others. Receiving the donation, the Minister of State, Hajiya Ramatu Tijani, thanked the management of the supermarket for the gesture, describing it as patriotic.
