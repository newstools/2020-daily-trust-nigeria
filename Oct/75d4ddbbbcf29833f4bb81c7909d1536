Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has faulted media reports that he had declared for the 2023 presidency. According to some social media reports, Tambuwal has picked Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers as his running mate. However, Tambuwal via a statement by his media aide, Muhammad Bello, said he has not declared his intention to contest for the presidency as reported by some social media outlets. “Governor Tambuwal has not declared his political intention in recent times, so the news about his running for the highest political office is a figment of the imagination of some overzealous social media activists. “For this reason, the governor dissociates himself from such fabricated misinformation and misleading reportage,” he said. It noted that the governor’s focus now was on delivering good governance and the dividends of democracy to the people of Sokoto State.
