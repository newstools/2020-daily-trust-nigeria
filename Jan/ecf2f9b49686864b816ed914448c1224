The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has vowed that his Administration will not allow the FCT to become a haven for illicit  drug operations and users, saying that a high percentage of criminality that occurs in the FCT is in one way or the other  linked to drug use and abuse. The minister said this when he received the new FCT National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Commander, Mr Hamisu Lawan, in his office. A statement by the minister’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye,  said Malam Bello promised to cooperate with and support the NDLEA to achieve  shared goals and objectives. The minister urged the new commander to exhibit the same passion and commitment for the job as exhibited by his predecessor, Mrs. Chinyere Obijuru, who, he said, worked very closely with the FCT Authorities in the fight against drug abuse and trafficking. The NDLEA commander thanked the minister for the Administration’s support to the agency over the years, especially in the “pin-down” operations being enforced in some dark spots across the city. He also expressed concern over the use of some gardens across the city as venues for drug consumption and abuse. He pledged the commitment of the NDLEA to arrest the ugly situation, reminding all that drug crimes are not only crimes on their own but can also lead to other forms of crime and criminality.
