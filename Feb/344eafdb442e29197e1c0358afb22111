A former member of the House of Representatives, Abdulmumini Jubirn yesterday said he will not quit politics. Jibrin lost his bid to the House weeks ago following his defeat at the rerun poll for Kiru/Bebeji Kano federal constituency. Speaking to journalists in Abuja, he said “I’m an advocate of everybody being involved in politics. So politics does not necessarily mean you own an office. You can be a journalist supporting democracy; you can be someone who takes his vote very seriously and exercises it; you can be an advocate.” “The future looks very bright. And one has had a very interesting career in the House in the last 10 years. In these years, I’ve been a lawmaker holding two very sensitive positions in the House; chairing the Finance and Appropriations committees simultaneously. “I spent 10 years without being accused of stealing money that belongs to the national assembly,” he said.
