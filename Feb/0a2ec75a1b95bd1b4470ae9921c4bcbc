The pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, yesterday backed the move by the Senate to reconsider reports of previous national confabs in the ongoing constitution review. Spokesman of the group, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, in an interview with Daily Trust said the move by the Senate was a welcome development. According to him, the report of the 2014 confab conducted by former President Goodluck Jonathan was all-encompassing and contained far-reaching recommendations which if well implemented would solve the challenges facing Nigeria. He said if the 2014 confab had been implemented, “we would not be talking about Amotekun today.” Also speaking, a Professor of Political Science at the Lagos State University, Sylvester Odion, said it is a welcome development if the proposal by the National Assembly would not be dogged by politics. Speaking with our correspondent, Odion advised that many reports that are currently gathering dust can be harmonised to give Nigeria a new constitution that would address the socio-political challenges facing the country. He said Nigeria is at a crossroads and restructuring has become imperative to address the challenge of insecurity. Acting National Chairman of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Supo Shonibare, on his part described the constitutional amendment committee set up by the Senate president as ‘superfluous’. “The El- Rufai Committee Report has aspects of devolution contained therein; more particularly the Revenue sharing formula and recommendations for State Police. “My only concern is that recent proposals for state police, have not addressed some of the germane issues which will also occasion the reform of the federal police,” he said.
