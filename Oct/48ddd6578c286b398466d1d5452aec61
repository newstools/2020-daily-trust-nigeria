No fewer than 8,550 primary six pupils at the weekend sat for the 2020 Paper Pencil Test (PPT) Entrance Examination (Screening Test) into Lagos State Model Colleges and upgraded Junior Secondary Schools in 55 centres across the state. The pupils were tested in two subjects including English Studies and Mathematics in various centres across the state. The Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, described the exercise as hitch-free, saying the turnout was very impressive. Adefisayo, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Mrs. Abosede Adelaja, said the 2020 admission into Model Colleges and Upgraded Junior Secondary Schools would be strictly on merit, noting that only pupils who performed well would be offered admission. She further disclosed that the PPT version for this year might be the last to be conducted as the state government was working towards conducting a Computer Based Test (CBT) next year.
