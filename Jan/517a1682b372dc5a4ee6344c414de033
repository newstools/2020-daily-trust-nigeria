Senate President Ahmad Lawan said yesterday that for Nigeria’s democracy to grow there must be a seamless relationship among institutions of government. Lawan who was the Special Guest of Honour at the Daily Trust dialogue was represented by Senate Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi. “Though there is no perfect democracy anywhere in the world, the hallmark of a good democracy is the ability to develop processes and procedures,” he said. “Institutions and tools of democracy are, most times, identified as the constitution, the political parties, and the electioneering process. Any democracy that seeks to grow must ensure that these sectors work seamlessly,” Lawan added. He said there was also the need to strengthen the country’s economy. “It is not a cheap system of government which is why we have to continue to expand our resource base,” he said. The National Assembly, Lawan said, was in tune with this realization, and had set machinery in motion for the timely passage of the electoral reforms amendment bill and the bill for the amendment of the 1999 Constitution. He said these bills were proposed for amendment based on the limitations the legislature realized in implementing them. “In reviewing them, therefore, the greater goal of service to fatherland and to the overall good of the people are our guiding principles,” he said.  …We must obey party supremacy — Oloriegbe Come and invest at home, Buni urges Yobe indigenes outside Senate presidency: Choice of Lawan not imposition — Group
