Some Gwagwalada residents have commended the area council for naming streets and numbering houses in the council. The proprietor of City Mart, Salako Olanrewaju Adewale, speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries said the exercise would open up the council to more development. “I want everybody to see the development of Gwagwalada as a symbiotic relationship. There are more institutions in Gwagwalada Area Council than other area councils. We have to develop Gwagwalada for ourselves, and as a resident, I did not hesitate to start a multimillion naira investment here, and I will still do more,” he said. The chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Mustapha Adamu Danze, flagged off the street naming and house numbering exercise in conjunction with a private firm. The chairman, who was represented by his vice chairman, Alhaji Kasimu Muhammad Ikwa, said the house numbering and street naming would help in ensuring even distribution and provision of amenities and proper planning. The consultant handling the exercise, Agu Okechukwu Samuel of Lion Property Enterprise Nigeria Limited, said the exercise would ensure easy accessibility to data which, he added, would enhance proper planning. He appealed for the support and cooperation of the residents in ensuring the success of the exercise.
