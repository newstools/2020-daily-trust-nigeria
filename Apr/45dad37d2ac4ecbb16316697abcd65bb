Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company, (IBEDC) has donated relief materials, including rice, semovita and noodles, to Osun State Government as part of its efforts to assist the government in providing palliatives to poor and vulnerable people in the state. The items, which comprised of 2,500 bags of rice (5kg) 3,000 bags of semovita (1kg) and 1,500 cartons of noodles would be distributed to indigent residents in the state. Ogunleye said the relief materials were replicated across all the states covered by IBEDC including Osun, Ogun, Oyo, Kwara, Niger, Kogi and Ekiti states. He said:  “In addition to this, we have committed to providing our customers regular power supply as much as it is within our remit and control.” This is even as he assured electricity consumers in the state that the DisCo would not disconnect non-paying customers during this period except on grounds of safety advice. According to him, the electricity distribution company’s technical crew are on ground to clear faults promptly as part of its CSR to support the various government initiatives and help reduce the hardship the lockdown has occasioned on the citizens.” The Commissioner for Commerce and Industry in the state, Dr. Bode Olanipekun, received the materials in Osogbo from IBEDC Regional Head, Osun Region, Mr. Akinleye Ogunleye. The commissioner commended the DisCo for the gesture and promised that the items would reach the targeted vulnerable people in the state.
