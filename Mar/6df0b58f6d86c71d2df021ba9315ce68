The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the judgement of Kogi State High Court, which voided the party’s governorship primary election conducted prior to the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state. The party said it has directed its team of lawyers to appeal the judgement, describing it as a classical example of “judicial rascality and scandalous travesty of justice.” A governorship aspirant on the platform of the PDP, Mohammed Ibrahim, had approached the High Court in the state challenging the emergence of Musa Wada as candidate of the party for the November 16, 2019 governorship election. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the judgement cannot stand, adding that “our party will stop at nothing in exploring all legal avenues to immediately set it aside at the appellate courts.” “For the avoidance of doubt, Nigerians are all aware that our great party, on the 3rd and 4th of November 2019, duly conducted our primary for the Kogi governorship election, which was monitored and certified by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and which produced our candidate, Engr. Musa Wada, who fully participated in the November 16th 2019 governorship election.
