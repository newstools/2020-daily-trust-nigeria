The Federal Capital Territory  (FCT) Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has said more roads will be for the purpose of solving the protracted traffic congestion in some of the road axis within the city centre. The Chairman, Ministerial Task Team on Traffic Management, Ikharo Attah, stated this during the inspection of the ongoing Inner Southern Park Carriage way projects. Attah said the minister is committed to ameliorating the suffering of residents by bringing sustainable solutions to disturbing traffic problems. He noted that the road stretch from AYA junction,  connecting Nyanya and Mararaba, leading to Area 1 and other parts of the city would soon  be opened to motorists. He said the minister has urged contractors to hasten and lay asphalt on the roads  so that they could be opened to ease the traffic on the Nyanya axis. “This interchange is a very sensitive portion of the road, because it distributes traffic coming from Nyanya axis that is having heavy vehicular traffic on daily basis. Those who try to connect Area one, via Ecowas secretariat and Power House junction,  may not need to go through that way once these links are opened up.
