About 11,331 pensioners have been paid N842.8 million by the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) in December 2019. A statement by the Executive Secretary of PTAD, Dr Chioma Ejikeme, said the payment was part of the commitment of the federal government to reduce inherited pension liabilities, assuring pensioners that their welfare remained a priority of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. She said PTAD had made its mandate clear before the commencement of the exercise. The NITEL/MTEL verification exercise, which started in February 2018, was for the purpose of verifying and enrolling eligible pensioners for the purpose of payment of monthly pension. This, she said is in line with the provisions of the Pension Reform Act (2014). “This was what the Directorate did in the cases of Delta Steel Company (DSC), Nigeria Reinsurance, Federal Housing Authority (FHA), NICON Insurance and Nigerian Defense Academy (NDA) civilians. “The pensioners who have served the country meritoriously in their various capacities deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. This is why PTAD staff and management will continue to work towards ensuring that the pensioners receive their pension entitlements as and when due,” Ejikeme said, as reported in the media. PTAD assured pensioners that the management will be guided by passion, transparency, accountability and drive which are the core values of the directorate.
