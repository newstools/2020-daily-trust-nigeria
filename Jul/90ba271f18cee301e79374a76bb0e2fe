The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that the All Progressives Congress (APC) was planning to use foreign “election mercenaries” to enable it rig the forthcoming governorship election in Edo state. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed September 19, 2020, for the election. Sequel to this, political parties in the country are fielding candidates for the election and warming up for campaigns. The ruling APC, has already announced its campaign team with Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano state as the head. The PDP in a statement on Friday, by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, also alleged that the trio of Governors Ganduje, Hope Uzodinma of Imo state and Yahaya Bello of Kogi State were mandated by the APC to “derail” the Edo election. “Part of APC’s plot is to import election mercenaries as observers to attempt to scare the people of Edo state, suppress them and steal their mandate. “The PDP and indeed, the people of Edo state are already aware that the trio were selected by the APC to lead its campaign so as to force a combined formula of Kano and Kogi electoral violence as well as Imo state mandate robbery to subvert the will of the people of Edo state in the governorship election. “It is however not surprising that such is the drift of the APC campaign, given that it has neither messages nor plans for the people of Edo state. “Whereas our candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, enjoys the overwhelming support of the Edo people due to his enthusing track record of personal character and performance in office for which even APC leaders have praises for him, the APC candidate has nothing to present to the people,” the party said.
