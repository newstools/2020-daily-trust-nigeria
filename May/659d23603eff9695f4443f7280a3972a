The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has donated palliatives to their partners who are taking care of vulnerable children and victims of human trafficking across the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Donating the items on Friday at NAPTIP head office in Abuja, the Director General, NAPTIP,  Julie Okah-Donli, said some orphanages and some shelters who take care of vulnerable children and victims of human trafficking were given priority. She said the palliatives were donated to NAPTIP by the Minister of State for FCT, Hajia Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, and were in turn distributed to seven other partners. “We were not sharing palliative in the past because that has not really been an issue and there was no need for that but we have been taking care of victims of human trafficking and when our shelters are full, we send them to these partners who take over from there,” she said.
