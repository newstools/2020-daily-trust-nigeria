Kaduna Electric has unveiled a special investigation and prosecution taskforce to crackdown on individuals and organisations engaged in energy theft and meter bypass within its franchise states. A statement by the spokesman, Abdulazeez Abdullahi said the taskforce comprises officials from the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, men of the Nigeria Police Force and staff of Kaduna Electric. During the inauguration which held at the company’s headquarter in Kaduna, the Managing Director, Engr. Garba Haruna charged the team to be professional in the discharge of their assignment and to be sincere in their dealings with electricity users. Represented by Mr Rahul Kumar, the Company’s Chief Driving Officer, the MD said the high frequency of meter bypass and energy theft was responsible for lost revenue running into millions of naira monthly, and partly accounts for the challenges facing the electricity sector. The Team Lead of the taskforce, Mr Aliyu Bamalli, assured that he was confident the team will carry out its mandate diligently and with integrity. “The mandate of the taskforce has no boundary. They can disconnect any customer no matter how big or small. The taskforce will disconnect any company that engages in any form of energy theft and will seek the prosecution of the company in court,” he said. Aliyu warned customers caught bypassing their meters or engaging in energy theft that they will be prosecuted alongside the staff of Kaduna Electric or the ‘NEPA 2’ responsible for bypassing the meter or connecting the premises illegally. The spokesman after the inauguration appealed to customers not to engage in meter bypass and energy theft to avoid the embarrassment of prosecution.
