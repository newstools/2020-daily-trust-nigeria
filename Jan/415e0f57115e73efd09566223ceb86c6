A resident of the area, Ismaila Yakubu, said the deceased was declared missing on Friday but his decomposing body was found behind a mini stadium along Agyana road in Abaji on Sunday evening.

He said the cyclist, who was from Zamfara State was not seen until on Sunday evening around 5:pm when his decomposing body was found inside the bush at the back of the mini stadium in the area. Yakubu said the corpse of the cyclist was buried according to Islamic rites after police men who were alerted arrived the scene and recorded the incident.
