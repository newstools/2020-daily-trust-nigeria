The Chairman of Kuje Area Council of the FCT, Abdullahi Suleiman Sabo, has ordered that impounded motorcycles be released to their owners. Sabo, who spoke through the councilâ€™s COVID-19 Task Force Chairman, Mr. Sunday Zaka, at the Kuje Police Division yesterday, instructed that all owners of the impounded commercial motorcycles must come forward with identification. He also said there must be a written agreement to warrant the release of the motorcycles to their rightful owners, even as he noted that the ban on commercial motorcycles in the area was still in effect. Mr. Kaka, therefore, warned commercial motorcycle operators to obey constituted authorities by plying only designated areas.
