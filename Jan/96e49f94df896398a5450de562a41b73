A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo state, Mr. Franklin Ibeh, has expressed regret over the position of an elder statesman, Tanko Yakassai, on the Supreme Court verdict which sacked Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and declared Senator Hope Uzodinma of the APC as the duly elected governor of the state. He said that the elder statesman embarked on a “fruitless voyage” in criticising the verdict. Ibeh, a loyalist of President Muhammadu Buhari, said that Yakassai’s statement contradicted his position that he is not a member of the PDP. While disagreeing with the elder statesman’s statement that the new governor of the state, Uzodinma, is a “senior Rochas Okorocha”, the APC chieftain said that the judgment was the true reflection of what transpired in the state on March 9, during the governorship election. Ibeh said: “The position of the elder statesman on Imo governorship debacle is highly bent and regrettable. The Supreme Court justices were meticulous in their judgement. There is no gain saying the fact the state now has a governor it had long desired to have. “The governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, is an ideal governor for Imo state. This is the first time we are having a governor who is not greedy, selfish and not interested in converting the people’s funds to himself, children and great grand children. “I am very sure that the elder statesman is judging the new governor of Imo state from affair. The new governor of Imo state is a former two-time Senator of the Federal Republic who understands the dynamic of both Imo state and national politics. He has come to reconstruct, rehabilitate and recover Imo state.” PDP to CJN: Recuse yourself in Bauchi, Sokoto, other gov’ship appeals Why Supreme Court sacked PDP's Ihedioha, declared APC's Uzodinma as Imo governor PDP asks S/Court panel to recuse in Bauchi, Sokoto, Benue, Adamawa governorship cases
