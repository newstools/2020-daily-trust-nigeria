Senator Ifeanyi Ubah (YPP, Anambra South) has urged mothers to remain absolutely committed to preventing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic to households. The lawmaker, in a statement, said no efforts made towards defeating the virus would make an impact without the full support of mothers. “It is for this reason that I request that they enforce complete adherence to the stipulated social distancing and personal hygiene rules amongst children and other family members as we all look forward to the firm control and total defeat of the virus,” Ubah, who is also the national leader of YPP, said.
