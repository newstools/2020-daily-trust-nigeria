The Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) has urged the three tiers of government to fund the Employees Compensation Scheme being implemented by the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) effectively to hinder post COVID-19 economic challenges. The Director General of NECA, Timothy Olawale, who made the call, noted that inadequate funding of the social sector and lack of reliable data constituted threats to the ability of Nigeria’s economy to withstand economic and social shocks during emergencies. He said: “The challenge confronting the model Nigeria adopted regarding the NSITF is that the Federal Government is not investing in social protection of its people. State governments are also not serious about deepening spending on social protection of their people. The Federal Government should fund the NSITF efficiently. As it is now, it is the private sector that is funding it. “If there is emergency confronting public workers, what happens? How will the Federal Government respond when it is not funding the NSITF the way it ought to? Where will it run to? Then, it will adopt the same stop-gap solutions to the challenge.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.

That is why we have uncoordinated approach that does not guarantee the delivery of targeted expectations because we were not prepared.” Olawale further said adequate funding of the social sector remained critical to preparing for social emergencies such as COVID-19.
