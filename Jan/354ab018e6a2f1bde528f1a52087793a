Operatives of the Nigeria Immigration Service at the Murtala  Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos intercepted nine girls who were travelling abroad without valid reasons. They were allegedly being trafficked to Lebanon, Cairo, Dubai and India. After interrogation, it was discovered that four of them claimed to be traveling to take up employments without knowing their employers, neither were they aware of the nature of job they were going for. The NIS said the trip was organized by agents. The NIS spokesman, Sunday James, said in a statement yesterday that two others who claimed to be going for a visit later confessed that they were going for illegal business in Dubai and the other two claimed they were going to India for medical treatment. They could not however provide any referral. James said: “Considering that the nine girls had no credible mission for embarking on the failed journey they were refused departure to save their lives and dignity.” He quoted the NIS Comptroller General of Nigeria  Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede as urging parents to be wary of juicy offers to their children by family members and others to take them abroad on deceitful planned trips for employment, studies or visits which may end up in exploitation or death. The service reiterated that its operatives at the various entry and exit points would not permit departure of anyone without a valid reason for travelling. Daily Trust reports that the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) had alerted on the activities of agents luring Nigerian girls abroad with “non-existent jobs.” Recently Nigerian authorities rescued a Nigerian woman, Omolola Ajayi, from Lebanon after a video where she was calling for help trended.
