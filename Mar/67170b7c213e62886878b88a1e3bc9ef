The candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in the 2019 governorship election in Lagos, Babatunde Gbadamosi, yesterday returned to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where he was a member. Gbadamosi was received by members of the state working committee led by the chairman, Engr. Adedeji Doherty, at the party secretariat in Ikeja. He joined PDP along with some other officers of ADP. The chairman, while receiving Gbadamosi, said the journey to take over from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has begun, saying Lagosians are tired of the ruling party. He said with the return of Gbadamosi, whom he said was on “sabbatical”, the party has been further reinvigorated to take over from the ruling party in the next elections. Gbadamosi said his return to PDP was to help in building a winning party which would end the “misrule” of the ruling party. He said PDP must come together as one united house to put an end to the APC hegemony in Lagos State. “My job in PDP is to help the efforts to build a winning team that will knock out these people (the ruling party), “ he said.
