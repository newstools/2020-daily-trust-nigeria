In a bid to ensure strict compliance to the cessation of movement so that the territory does not witness an escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases and prevent a public health emergency, the FCT Minister has said that markets will henceforth operate only on Wednesday and Saturday. The Minister further stated that mobile courts will be activated to try violators of the order. The minister who spoke during a COVID-19 Security Committee, yesterday, lamented that residents have used the excuse of going to the market to flout the lockdown directive. He also said compliance at the satellite towns has been discouraging. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the minister, Mr Anthony Ogunleye, said “market operational days are henceforth reduced to two days in a week namely Wednesdays and Saturdays only;  Residents should patronize only neighborhood markets as movement from one district to the other now constitutes a violation of the lockdown. “Mobile courts will now be activated to try all violators of the directive on the cessation of movement across the FCT.” The new guidelines also barred motorcycles  (Okada) from operating anywhere in Kubwa and Dutse Alhaji during the lockdown. “The FCTA will step up sensitization efforts especially in the rural communities and enjoins area council chairmen, traditional rulers and community leaders to actively engage in sensitizing the populace on the dangers of COVID -19,” the statement added.
