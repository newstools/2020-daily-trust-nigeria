The resurgence of insecurity in some parts of Northern Nigeria and the global outbreak of Coronavirus has led to the postponement of the 20th anniversary celebration of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) earlier scheduled for March. ACF is a political and cultural association of leaders in Northern Nigeria. The forum’s Secretary General, Anthony Sani, stated at the General Assembly meeting in Kaduna that planning and organization of the ceremony commenced six months ago but the recent resurgence of kidnappings and killings in the north and particularly Kaduna State as well as the global outbreak of coronavirus impinged the leadership to keep the event on hold till further notice. “To mark its 20th Anniversary, the forum thought of celebrating the occasion in March, 2020 with a view to assessing progress made since its inception in the year 2000 and in consequence to raise money for its services,” he said. He, however, noted that the preparations and mobilization of the people have been very encouraging as depicted by the enthusiastic responses of the governors of the 19 Northern states and other stakeholders across the country. The secretary general also said the amendment of the ACF Constitution, 2011, was in progress with the relevant Committee, adding that as soon as it is done, the leadership will take appropriate action for its ratification and adoption. While giving his report to the General Assembly, he said due to paucity of funds, the forum was unable to achieve all it planned for and had embarked on some austerity measures such as limiting its activities to existential ones and reducing the frequency of meetings of the National Working Committee (NWC) and the National Executive Council (NEC) from monthly to bi-monthly. The forum is expected to ratify and announce new leadership today.
