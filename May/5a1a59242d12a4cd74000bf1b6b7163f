Newspapers Vendors Association, Abuja (NVAA), has concluded plans to capture the biometric data of all members of the association operating in the nation’s capital. The Chairman of NVAA, Comr Etim Iwara,  in a statement he signed and made available to City News,  called on members to go to the association’s secretariat at the distribution centre, Area 1, Abuja, with their details for capturing. According to Iwara, it had become necessary to capture the data of vendors because of the recent happenings in Abuja, which have negative effects on the business of newspaper vending in the Federal Capital Territory. The chairman emphasised the need for a comprehensive data base of members, for easy identification by the association and government agencies such as Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) and Abuja Enterprise Agency (AEA).

He warned that any member who failed to forward his or her details for capturing should consider himself or herself out of the business. Iwara stressed that the exercise is expected to end before the end of May, 2020.
