Seven companies will pay N111.4 billion as interim dividend to their shareholders following their audited accounts for operations in the first half or this year.

The seven companies are Access bank Plc, 11 PLC, Zenith bank plc, Guarantee Trust Bank, Stanbic IBTC, United bank for Africa, and telecom giant, MTN Nigeria. MTN investors saw the biggest share as they will earn N3.50k per share, about N71.2bn. it is among the top gainers with a double-digit surge in the first quarter of 2020. Zenith Bank Plc was the second highest with a total payout of N9.4bn at 30kobo per share. Access bank and GTB have proposed a total payout of N8.8bn respectively.
