Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun yesterday said there was no plan for its state to pull out of Operation Amotekun. Abiodun and his Lagos and Osun States counterparts were absent at inauguration of the security outfit on Thursday in Ibadan; a development fuelling speculations of a plan to pull out of the operation. Addressing newsmen in Sagamu yesterday, Abiodun said all the six western governors jointly subscribed to the security outfit. He noted that he was represented at the inauguration of the operation by his deputy. Abiodun said his state had donated 20 operational vehicles to the initiative.
