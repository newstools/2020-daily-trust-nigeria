The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that Nigeria has expressed interest to be part of the global solidarity drug trial to tackle COVID-19 pandemic and that the process would soon start in the country. The Officer in charge, WHO Nigeria and member of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Dr. Fiona Braka, told Daily Trust in an exclusive interview yesterday in Abuja that what Nigeria signed up for was drug trial and not vaccine trial, as there is yet no vaccine for the COVID-19. According to her, the four drugs that will be monitored in the solidarity trial are Remdesivir, Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir, and Ritonavir. She said over 100 countries had joined the solidarity trial and till date, over 1,200 patients had been randomized from the first five countries to evaluate the safety and efficacy of full drug and drug combinations.
