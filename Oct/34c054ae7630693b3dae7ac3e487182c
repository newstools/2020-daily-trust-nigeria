Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has threatened to take legal action over alleged removal of 22 political parties from participating in the forthcoming local council election by Gombe State Independent Electoral Commission (GOSIEC). The state chairman of IPAC, Abdulhamid Sadiq, alleged that 22 parties that indicated interest to contest in the election were disqualified by the commission. He said 40 registered political parties under the IPAC in the state conducted primary elections under the supervision of GOSIEC on October 19, “but after the successful conduct of the primaries the commission disqualified 22 parties.” However, GOSIEC’s Permanent Commissioner, Public Affairs and Information, Mr Bulus Kudi, denied disqualifying any political party from participating in the election. He told Daily Trust in a phone interview that the said 22 political parties were excluded because they were not on the list of duly registered political parties in the country.
