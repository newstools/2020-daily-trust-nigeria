Edo State Government has re-certified 300 cooperative societies in the state as part of measures to checkmate the use of proxy cooperatives to defraud members of the public The State Commissioner for Wealth Creation, Cooperatives and Employment, Dr Felix Akhabue, who gave this hint in his remarks at a stakeholders’ meeting in Benin, said the move would streamline the activities of cooperative societies as catalysts for economic development. According to him, cooperative societies help to galvanizing all segments of the society for economic prosperity. He pointed out  that  the challenges faced by stakeholders in the state include the prevalence of proxy cooperative societies which rely on their registration in defrauding members of the public. Akhabue said: “Some persons used questionable cooperative societies to access loans provided by governments after which they disappeared and till date, the money has not been recovered. “The Edo State cooperatives database has been cleaned up with about 300 registered cooperative societies vetted and certified as against the 18,000 that populated the database in the past. The elimination of dormant and proxy cooperative societies will help the ministry to project and recommend only active cooperatives for financial assistance and benefits”, he added The commissioner assured  government’s commitment to protect cooperative societies from financial fraud while also ensuring transparency and accountability in their operations. In his remarks at the forum, President of God’s Gift Minerals Multipurpose Cooperative Society, Mr. Ehigbobo Ehimen, commended the state government for the efforts to create a new order through the recertification exercise. He, however, urged members to key into the new order to enhance growth and ensure that genuine cooperative societies benefit from funding opportunities.
