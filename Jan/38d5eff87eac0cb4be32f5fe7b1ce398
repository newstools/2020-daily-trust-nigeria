Ebonyi State Government has said Operation Amotekun security outfit constituted in the South-West was its brainchild. The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace, Mr. Stanley Emegha, stated this in an interview with journalists in Abakaliki. He explained that the South East security outfit operation is led by retired Gen. Obi Umahi who is an elder brother to Ebonyi State governor. He noted that by the end of January, the security efforts and plan of the region would have been made clearer. “The launch of Amotekun in the South West is what is already in vogue in Ebonyi State, in particular, and South-East, in general. This is so because traces of insecurity like kidnapping, car-snatching, armed robbery, are no longer found in Ebonyi State. “The actual region the governor of Kano was talking about for this security initiative, is the South-East, not the Southwest. What they have done is they have just copied what is already in existence in Ebonyi. “This kind of security strategy is being put in place and has been made possible by the South-East Security Consultant, Gen. Obi Umahi (retd).” Details scanty as ‘Operation Amotekun’ starts in S/West Amotekun: Inside South-West security outfit South West govs allay fears, as Amotekun security outfit takes off
