A former publicity secretary of the APC in Edo State, Godwin Erhahon, has described the call on the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, to resign over the Supreme Court judgement on Bayelsa State as mischievous. The Supreme Court had disqualified the governor-elect, David Lyon, less than 24 hours to his inauguration on the ground that his deputy presented fake credentials. Erhahon, who spoke yesterday in Benin, said in the case of Bayelsa election, Oshiomhole was a victim of sabotage as the screening committee was headed by a distinguished senator, He said the party boss had, during the inauguration, warned the committee to be thorough in their screening and avoid any loophole that could lead to a judicial voiding of a hard earned victory. “It is never the responsibility of the national chairman to screen candidates for election. “Only mischief makers would blame the national chairman of a political party for the error in the credentials of a candidate who was screened and cleared for the election,” he said.
