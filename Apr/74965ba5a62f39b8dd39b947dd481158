The Joint Health Sector Union has rejected disparity in payment of hazard allowance for health workers in the frontline of battling COVID-19. JOHESU Chairman Comrade Joy Bio Josiah, in a statement on Monday, said the hazard allowance could not be tied to the basic salary of health workers. He noted that every health worker, be it doctor, pharmacist, lab scientist, mortuary attendant, or cleaner is exposed to similar hazards and should be paid equally. “To simplify and be just, everybody should be paid equally, depending on the length of time at work,” Josiah said. The JOHESU also called for equal life insurance for all health workers, saying “relatives of dead people are as bereaved as any other.” Strike settlement threatens more rift in health Strike: JOHESU, gang up against Nigerian people, govt. - Doctors NLC urged to stand by N56,000 minimum wage demand
