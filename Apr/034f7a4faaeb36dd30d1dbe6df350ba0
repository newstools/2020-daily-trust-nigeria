The National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS) and West African Institute for Trade and Agricultural Development (WAITAD) have called on the federal and state governments to critically appraise the food security implications of COVID-19 with a view to coming up with food security measures to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on vulnerable Nigerians. The groups, which made this call in a statement signed by NANTS president, Dr. Ken Ukaoha, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had widely exposed the unsustainability of Nigeria’s reliance on oil and the “mirage of reclining on the vagaries and impulses of international oil market economy”. While recalling that in recent weeks funding and governance attention have been concentrated in the health sector, the associations, however, cautioned that food insecurity and the livelihoods of the population will be another looming disease facing the country, which appear not to be enjoying adequate attention and strategic planning by the government at all levels. They warned that after the pandemic, there will be an “imminent second and perhaps most dangerous battle ahead, which is gross food insecurity.” The groups pointed out that the gains recently made by the Federal Government’s policy on land border closure against food commodities smuggled into the country, “which rightly culminated in reduction of rice and poultry import bills, among others, are speedily being eroded by the COVID-19 pandemic”. They further urged the Federal Government to urgently awaken Nigerian economic managers, including the President’s Economic Advisory Council to begin immediate considerations and thinking outside the box preparatory to addressing post COVID-19 economic environment, particularly vis-à-vis the future of food security before it comes too late. “We are strongly concerned that at the moment, producers, transporters, traders and other production value chain actors are asked to stay at home thereby implicating a stagnated economy sinking further into the doldrums courtesy of the COVID-19 induced policies and regulations”, they stated. The groups, while calling on all traders nationwide to desist from hiking of food prices at challenging period, urged to them to learn from the sacrifices by doctors, nurses and other medical workers, who are daily risking their lives by daily combating the pandemic through treatment of patients/victims of the dreaded disease.
