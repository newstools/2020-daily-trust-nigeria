Hyundai, Nissan and Changan – popular automotive brands assembled in Nigeria by Stallion Motors, were among the brands that featured at the just ended Federal government-organised made-in-Nigeria automobile parade in Abuja. The Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, commended the auto maker and other participants for the quality of automobiles showcased and assured Nigerians of President Muhammadu Buhari’s resolve to explore the industry for job creation. The Director General of the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Mr. Jelani Aliyu, also lauded local assemblers and urged Nigerians to encourage and support them by shunning importation in favour of made-in-Nigeria vehicles. Stallion, during the parade, unleashed its entire range of made-in-Nigeria vehicles from the brand house of Hyundai, Nissan, Changan and Honda. Stallion Group’s General Manager, Marketing, Arpita Roy Luthra, described its paraded brands as a testimony of the company’s effort at supporting Nigeria’s auto manufacturing capacity through production of automobiles made in Nigeria by Nigerians. Similarly, at the 2020 Argungu auto rally, most of the Nigerian vehicles showcased at the event were specially prepared for the rally of which Stallion was a title sponsor. Luthra explained that, “We are being represented by three popular Nigerian manufactured vehicles, namely Hyundai Creta, Nissan NP 300 and Changan CS 35. “Hyundai Creta, Nigeria’s largest selling new car in the crossover segment, controls 34 per cent of the total segment share and is tropicalised with best in class ground clearance of 190mm and unmatched five years of warranty.”  Stallion’s upward streak continues to climb N1.5m made-in-Nigeria Hyundai car debuts Hyundai, Stallion partner  to make vehicles in Nigeria
