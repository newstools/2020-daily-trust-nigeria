The National Leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu yesterday decried insinuations alleging that he deliberately turned down an invitation from Ondo State Government in commemoration of the third anniversary of the state. Tinubu’s Media Aide, Mr. Tunde Rahman while speaking in Lagos, said that the APC leader did not turn down the invitation of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. He said that Tinubu was invited by Akeredolu in commemoration of the third anniversary of his administration in Ondo State and to inaugurate some iconic projects initiated by his administration. President Muhammadu Buhari was in the state on Tuesday to commission some projects. Rahman explained that the APC leader was invited to the state to inaugurate projects which include the Ondo-Linyia Industrial Hub, Ore among other landmark projects of his regime. “But the APC leader could not honour the invitation as scheduled because of an earlier scheduled trip abroad. “As much as I know, Asiwaju Tinubu did not turn down the invitation; the date suggested by Gov. Akeredolu coincided with the timing of an already scheduled trip overseas by Asiwaju. He did not reject the invitation. Opposition politicians in the state had interpreted Tinubu’s inability to keep the initial date for the inauguration of the projects as a clear rejection of the Gov. Akeredolu and his projects.
