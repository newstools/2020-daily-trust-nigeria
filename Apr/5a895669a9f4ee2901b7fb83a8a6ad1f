The Ogun State government yesterday commenced the disinfection of police stations, markets, malls, motor parks and other public places across the 20 local government areas of the state. The exercise, which began on Tuesday at Kuto market, Abeokuta, saw the officials spreading public places with disinfectants in view of the ravaging coronavirus disease. The Secretary to the State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, told newsmen that the disinfection would be done simultaneously across the three senatorial districts in the state. Talabi said the government was taking advantage of the lockdown to carry out the exercise, which he said would be extended to churches, mosques, police stations, schools and other public places. The SSG, who addressed newsmen alongside the Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Samson Odedina and his Environment counterpart, Hon Abiodun Abudu-Balogun, disclosed that the government had also started the distribution of food items to cushion the effects of the lockdown on the residents of the state. He said  “Everywhere in the state is to be captured. Anywhere you have a gathering of large people. Of course, we are not going to go inside the bush for now. “We are starting with the biggest high traffic areas, which include the markets and high street where you have shops. We are taking this opportunity of the lockdown to also disinfect the schools before our children go back there.” He enjoined residents of the state to participate in the exercise by disinfecting their houses in order to prevent a spread of the virus.
