The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, yesterday in Abuja assured that the federal government was willing to evacuate Nigerians who wish to return home from abroad as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic. According to him, the ministry has sent words across to embassies to ascertain how many Nigerians would indicate interest to return. “Our Permanent Representative to the UN in Vienna has been able to secure from the International Atomic Energy Agency a donation of 80,000 Euros worth of medical equipment and supplies to assist in our Covid19 response,” Onyeama said. “We have sent communications to all our Embassies and Missions to ascertain if and how many Nigerians want to return home because of COVID19. As soon as we collate the numbers, we will start looking at evacuation modalities where necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has donated medical equipment and supplies worth €80,000 to Nigeria to assist in the fight against the COVID-19 Pandemic. Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama said this yesterday in Abuja at the fifth joint national briefing of the Presidential Taskforce Force (PTF) on COVID-19 headed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha. He said the Nigerian Permanent Representative at the United Nations (UN) in Vienna, Austria, secured the donation on behalf of the country.
