He said the deceased vigilante and his colleague were trekking to meet their colleagues for their daily patrol when they ran into the robbers. According to the source, the robbers attempted to shoot the two vigilante members but that the gun did not fire and that one of the robbers drew a machete and hacked one of them (vigilante) to death.

Another resident, simply identified as Suleiman, lamented the rise in robbery attacks, especially within Zuba Metropolis. Suleiman said, “Just last week Wednesday, robbers invaded some houses at Zuba T-Junction and dispossessed victims of their valuables, including cash.” He added that if not with the help of the vigilantes, some residents would have relocated elsewhere “and that is why the robbers are now going after the vigilante members.” The spokesman of the FCT Police Command, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, did not pick calls put through to him to confirm the incident. He also did not reply to a text message sent to his mobile phone.
