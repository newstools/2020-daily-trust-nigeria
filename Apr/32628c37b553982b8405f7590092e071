The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) has exonerated itself from any blame over the electrocution of a 14-year old boy, Ekene Ezeh in Abaji, FCT, saying there is no supply from AEDC power source in the community when the incident occurred. The DisCos Head, Corporate Communications, Oyebode Fadipe in a statement clarified: “We deny vehemently the subliminal message of culpability and seek that your highly respected medium will give voice to our position as has been given to the story that has given rise to it.” While it was reported that the boy was electrocuted in Abaji, an area council in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), AEDC enquired if every electrocution case is attributable to electricity from public power supply managed by AEDC. The electricity distribution company’s spokesman maintained that from the DisCos’ preliminary investigations, the death of the deceased was not as a result of electricity from public power grid. He stated: “There was no power supply from AEDC as at the time (2:00pm) the boy was said to have slumped. Even the father of the deceased said he suspected that the cause of death was as a result of electric shock from a naked wire “that passed through zinc in a kiosk close to where he works.” Fadipe  said the accident was neither reported at AEDC office nor the police station in Abaji, adding also that “there is no medical report to show that death was secondary to electrocution.” Abuja Disco fined N18m over 8-yr old electrocution Ona of Abaji tasks AEDC on improved power supply Electrocution: Father of 7-year-old boy demands justice
