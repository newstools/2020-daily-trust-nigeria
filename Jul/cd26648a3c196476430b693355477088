A Federal High Court in Abuja has rejected a suit by the national headquarters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), challenging the powers of the Ogun State chapter of the party to conduct party congresses in the state. In his judgement, Justice Ahmed Mohammed held that the case amounted to an invitation to his court to sit on appeal over an already determined question before another judge of the same Federal High Court. Justice Mohammed consequently declined jurisdiction over the case, and held that the subsisting judgment delivered on June 24, 2016 by Justice I. N. Buba in a suit marked: FHC/L/CS/636/2016 had resolved the issue on whether or not the Ogun State PDP exco could conduct congresses in the state. The judge, who noted that the 2016 suit was filed in the Lagos division of the court by Chief Adebayo Dayo as Ogun State chairman and on behalf of the state PDP exco, held that parties in both the old and the new cases are the same. He proceeded to strike out the new suit. The national PDP had, in the latest suit, prayed the court to among others, hold that by virtue of the party’s amended constitution of 2017, the 2020 PDP Guidelines for the conduct of congresses, the 1999 Constitution and the Electoral Act, it was the exclusive function of the National Working Committee of the PDP to appoint congress committee members for the purpose of conducting elections into the party’s executive offices from the ward to national level.
