A divisional Court of Appeal, sitting in Abuja, has dismissed an appeal filed by a former Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye. The appeal was filed to challenge the result of the November 2019 by-election in which Senator Smart Adeyemi was declared the winner. In a verdict by Justice Ibrahim Saulawa-led three-man panel, delivered on Tuesday, the court upheld the June 10, 2020 judgment of the Kogi State National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal, Abuja, which upheld Adeyemi’s victory. Following the November 30, 2019 rerun election in 53 polling units, which was ordered by the Court of Appeal, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared Adeyemi the winner of the election.
