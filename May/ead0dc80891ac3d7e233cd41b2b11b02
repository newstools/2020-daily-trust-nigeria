Kaduna State Government has said 65 almajirai and two policemen are among the 72 active COVID-19 cases in the state. This is coming on the heel of the state government’s disclosure that it had discharged two patients, thereby bringing the total number of treated and discharged cases in the state to eight with a record of one fatality. A statement issued by Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s Special Adviser on Media and Communications, Muyiwa Adekeye stated that the seven other COVID-19 cases on admission are persons with travel history outside Kaduna State or their contacts. “Since the index case was reported on 28 March 2020, the state has discharged eight patients and has recorded one fatality that died before his positive test result was received.

The statement urged residents not to compromise in exposing and reporting those who sneak into the state, adding that “they should not be allowed to spread sickness and make nonsense of the sacrifices the people of Kaduna State are making in enduring the tough but necessary measures announced to protect them.” It further disclosed that the State Standing Committee was aware of documented instances of police and paramilitary personnel involvement in illegal interstate travel deals and described such actions as unfortunate. The statement also stressed that the fact that two policemen are among the 72 persons the state government is treating for COVID-19 should serve as a reminder to everyone that nobody is immune from the virus. 50 almajirai infected with COVID-19 in Kaduna Kaduna records first COVID-19 fatality 16 new Almajiris from Kano test positive for COVID-19 in Kaduna
