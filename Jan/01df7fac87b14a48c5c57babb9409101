Ten years after the attacks on 87 communities in Barkin Ladi, Riyom and Jos South local government areas of Plateau State, the Jos South Chapter of Jama’atu Nasril Islam has organised a special prayer session to commemorate those who lost their lives in the incidents. The JNI explained that more than 10,000 persons were reported to have been killed in the massacre of January 19, 2010, in villages of Kuru Karama, TimTim, Sabon Gidan Kanar, Gero and other villages in the identified council areas. Alh. Danladi Garba, Jos South JNI chairman said the session was organised to pray and commemorate the victims of the attacks especially those who lost their lives, noting that “the brutality carried upon us, our families and relatives over the last decade cannot be forgotten. It was one of the saddest memories we have encountered as humans where over 10,000 people across villages of Riyom, Jos South and Barkin Ladi LGAs were killed and thousands of people displaced.” In his remark at the event, Alhaji Babayo TimTim, a resident of Tim village of Jos South and State Chairman of Coalition of Internally Displaced Persons (CIDPs), described the incident as unfortunate, and prayed that it would never be witnessed again. Abdullahi Abubakar Wase, secretary of CIDPs, appreciated the efforts of the state governor towards permanent peace in the state, and called on the people to live in peace with one another.
