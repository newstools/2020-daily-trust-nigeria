A team of professors from the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria says it has found a cure for COVID-19. Speaking exclusively with Daily Trust on Wednesday, one of the leading researchers, Professor Haruna Abdu Kaita, said the COVID-19 remedy was developed from local plants that are available in different parts of Nigeria. This is coming few days after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the importation of COVID Organics, a herbal syrup being fronted by Andry Rajoelina, the president of Madagascar, as both a vaccine for the prevention and cure of COVID-19. President Buhari’s decision had attracted criticism from different quarters in Nigeria with the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria describing it as an insult on the country’s group of pharmacists, scientists, and researchers.

This, he said, would be kept as their intellectual property. He added that an elder statesman and former Vice-Chancellor of the ABU, Professor Abdullahi Mustapha, is also part of the team.
