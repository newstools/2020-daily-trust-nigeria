Abubakar said he reported the case to the DPO in Egume who moblised his men to the scene and evacuated the corpses. He noted that after a similar attack in March, the Commissioner of Police, CP Ede Ayuba, visited the Fulani community and promised to apprehend the perpetrators. He appealed to the State government to protect his members from further attacks. The police spokesman, DSP William Ayah, confirmed the incident and casualties. He said the commissioner of police had deployed men to the area to forestall a reprisal, while expressing the command’s readiness to bring the perpetrators to book.
