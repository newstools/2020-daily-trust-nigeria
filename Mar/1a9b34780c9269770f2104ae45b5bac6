President Buhari yesterday urged Nigerians not to panic about the news of the first case of coronavirus in the country. The president, in a statement yesterday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said “undue alarm would do us more harm than good.” Buhari said Nigerians should, instead, strictly observe the advisories disseminated by the Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation on the best way to prevent infection. According to him, this information is being broadcast in all available media by the Federal Ministry of Information. President Buhari noted with sadness, the recent confirmation of a case of Covid-19 infection in Lagos, Nigeria. He said this was despite the ardent efforts of the government regarding preparedness and response measures put in place in our country’s borders and beyond. President Buhari, however, commended the Federal Ministry of Health and other relevant agencies whose diligence and efficiency enabled the case to be detected, diagnosed and isolated quickly, even while swift measures were taken to identify and follow up on those with whom the index patient came into contact. The president commended the responses of the Federal Ministry of Health and Governments of Lagos and Ogun States as well as other relevant agencies to the reported incident and calls for vigilance on the part of all citizens and responsible government agencies.
