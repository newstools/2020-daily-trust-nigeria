An educationist in Ogun State, Professor David Bamgbose, has described the lockdown extension by the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, as the “height of insensitivity to the plight of the people.” Abiodun had on Friday extended the lockdown in the state by one week, citing increased number of COVID-19 cases and the residents’ non-compliance with safety measures. Bamgbose, who was the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the last general elections, told journalists in Abeokuta at the weekend that Abiodun did not ‘‘consider the adverse effects of the lockdown of the economy and people of the state’’. He submitted that the extension was not connected to necessary and adequate palliatives. Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.

He said, “So if we are locked down, do we have the kits to test the people? I’m saying that the Governor in announcing this latest extension didn’t take into cognisance the effect of hunger and the problem of the lockdown on people of the state. “Lagos State is the epicentre of coronavirus in the country and it is not locked down. There are measures that can be enforced, like the social distancing and the compulsory use of nose mask, among others. “Oyo State has not been on lockdown and it is yet to record the number of coronavirus cases that we have recorded. “So I’m calling on our governor that this action is causing a lot of economic hardship for the people’’.
