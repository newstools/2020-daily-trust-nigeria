The leadership of Kano State House of Assembly has asked a Federal High Court in the state to set aside an order it made to enforce judgement that reinstated the five lawmakers suspended by the house. The Assembly prayed for the court to set aside the Form 48 issued as a precursor to the issuing of Form 49, which will summon the speaker and the Clerk to the House to come and show cause why they should not be committed to prison for contempt of court. Relying on order 26 of the court, the counsel to the suspended lawmakers, Nuraini Jimoh sought an adjournment, and in granting the request, the presiding judge, Justice Lewis Allagoa, fixed July 6 for hearing. The lawmakers, who were suspended in February for allegedly opposing the dethronement of Muhammadu Sanusi II as emir of Kano, are Isyaku Ali Danja, Garba Yaâ€™u Gwarmai, Labaran Abdul Madari, Mohammed Bello Butu-Butu and Salisu Ahmed Gwangwazo. Recall that on June 4, the court described the suspension of the lawmakers as null and void and therefore ordered their reinstatement. Daily Trust reports that the assembly has been under lock for over two months following the lockdown imposed on the state as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby making it impossible for the reinstated lawmakers to resume plenary.
