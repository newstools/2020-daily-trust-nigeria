FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has directed that three syndicates be set up to review existing strategies with a view to overcoming the security challenges confronting the territory. This directive was issued during the first monthly FCT Security Committee meeting for the year 2020. According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the minister, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, the three teams will amongst other goals examine specific security challenges within the FCT, map out proactive measures of crime prevention and identify possible challenges towards achieving the FCTA’s security mandate. “The teams will each have as members, representatives of the various security agencies in the FCT, traditional and religious leaders, all the six area council chairmen, relevant departments within the FCTA as well as the media. “All teams have four weeks to submit their reports at the next Security Committee meeting,” the statement added. The minister also said that the FCT would explore and consider the concept of community policing, which he said, would aid the police in executing its functions. Bello encouraged residents not to despair as the FCT Administration was taking all the necessary measures to safeguard lives and property of residents.
