The Ona of Abaji and Chairman of the FCT council of traditional rulers, His Royal Majesty (HRM) Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has called on Egbura indigenes in his chiefdom to continue to sustain peaceful coexistence among themselves and other ethnic groups in the area. Alhaji Yunusa, who made the call at the first edition of the celebration of Igabazi Carnival and Cultural display in the area, also urged the Egbura indigenes to ensure they sustained the Egbura culture and traditions. He urged the Egbura people to always identify their culture as it was the only way it could be preserved. The traditional ruler also called on parents to ensure they send their children to acquire education, saying education was the only key to the development of any society. Also speaking, the Chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, congratulated the Egbura indigenes for organising their first cultural carnival, saying that showcasing their culture and tradition was an indication of peace and unity between them and other ethnic groups in the area. The chairman therefore called on residents, especially the youths, to stay away from social vices, saying living in peace with one another supersedes other things in any society. “And aside that, I also want to call on all of us to support our security agents to address issues of kidnappings and other forms of crimes in our environment because security is a collective responsibility of all of us,” he said. The event witnessed traditional display by Egbura local musicians, local hunters and presentation of award and prizes to some participants at the event.
