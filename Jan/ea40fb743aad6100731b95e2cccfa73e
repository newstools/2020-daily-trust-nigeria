The Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital (FNPH), Kware Committee on free distribution of drugs to less privileged persons suffering mental illness, says it receives about 100 requests daily. The Committee Chairman, Salihu Mande, who disclosed this, said Zakat and Endowment Commission provided N1 million monthly for drugs to support vulnerable persons suffering from mental illness. He, however, decried the attitude of some individuals and groups  towards the free medication programme. ‘‘At times some well -to -do persons, who can afford medication, approach the committee for the free drugs,” he disclosed. Mande, who is the Principal of School of Post Basic Nursing in the hospital added: “Some people with prescriptions which cost below N500 also approach the committee for the free drugs.” He said the committee received an average of between N250,000 to N300,000 requests every day, adding that if it had to meet all the request, the committee would exhaust the money within days. The chairman said that people from different parts of the country access medication at the hospital because of the quality of its services. Mande called on well-to-do persons, groups and organisation to emulate Zakkat commission, given the impact of the scheme on patients.
