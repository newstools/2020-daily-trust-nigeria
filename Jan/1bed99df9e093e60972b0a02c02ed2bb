The Imo State chapter of the APC says it is behind the suspended local government chairmen who, last Monday, invaded their former offices across the 27 local government areas (LGAs) to assume office. The former chairmen said that they acted on the strength of Supreme Court ruling, in the case between their counterparts in Ekiti and the state government, which said that the state government had no powers to sack elected local government chairmen. The APC, in a statement signed by the State Publicity Secretary,  Jones Onwuasoanya, said that it was “saddened by recent developments in our dear State, where the present governor and his agents have shown a most disturbing and ridiculous disdain for the rule of law, democracy and decency, by among other things, resisting the long overdue resumption of duty by legitimately elected LGA officials across the 27 LGAs of the State and engaging the services of hooligans from outside the State to unleash mayhem on ordinary Imolites for insisting on respect for rule of law and democracy.” The party further accused the state government of “retaining illegally appointed usurpers across the 27 LGA headquarters and using State power to intimidate, harass and stampede law abiding Imolites, especially, members of the APC in the State. “This action is responsible for the unfortunate and avoidable death of Hon. Ahamefula Mmaduabuchi, a supervisory councillor in Isu LGA of the State.” The party reiterated that the August 25, 2018 local government elections were conducted in line with extant provisions of the amended 1999 Constitution and the Imo State Amended Local Government Administration Law 15, 2000.
