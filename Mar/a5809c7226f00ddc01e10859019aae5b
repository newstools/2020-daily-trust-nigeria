The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State has said the outcome of last Saturday’s by-election in Patigi area of the state has revealed that the people of the state still have faith in it. A statement by the Publicity Secretary of the PDP in the state, Tunde Ashaolu, said “Even in the face of intimidation and financial inducement, people still have faith in the PDP and stood by our candidate, Mohammed Yahaya.” It commended members and supporters of the party for their determination and conduct during the exercise, stressing that Kwara PDP is committed to peaceful and credible elections. It added that the low turnout of voters recorded during the election and the outcome of the exercise were a clear demonstration that the people have lost faith in the government of APC due to its lacklustre performance in the state. “The APC no doubt performed below the expectations of Kwarans. It has irredeemably failed to fulfil any of its electoral promises to the people,” it claimed. It stated that it should be of concern to all Kwarans that the APC government has failed to formulate any sustainable policy or implement any tangible project that will improve the lives of the people.
