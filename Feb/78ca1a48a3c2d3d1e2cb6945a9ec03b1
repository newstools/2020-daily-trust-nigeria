Former Head of State and Chancellor of PAMO University of Medical Sciences, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd) has expressed worry over heightening insecurity in the country. Speaking in Port Harcourt on Monday at the First Founders Day Ceremony of PAMO University of Medical Sciences, he called on Nigerians to support the government in the fight to halt the insecurity menace. General Abubakar said insecurity in the country has become worrisome and that it requires every Nigerian to join forces in providing intelligence to the security agencies. “It is high time we stood up to fight insecurity in the country. We are all praying for peace to return to the country,” he said. He said it was his administration that first granted licence for the establishment of private universities in the country twenty-one years ago, noting that venturing into private university development helps in economic development. He commended the founder of PAMO University, Dr Peter Odili in setting the pace in establishing the first private medical science university in the country. Executive Secretary National Universities Commission (NUC), Professor Abubakar Rasheed said the Commission will continue to ensure that the university complies with regulations guiding the establishment of private universities. Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State promised to support sons and daughters of the state who initiate private university venture, just as he donated a sum of N500m for the construction of hostel accommodation for the students of the university. 74 private universities inadequate – Abdulsalami Federal cabinet approves 6 new private universities FEC approves six new private universities
