Daily Trust findings showed that many customers were still not satisfied with the level of power supply in some major cities nationwide. For instance, among the complaints on Twitter in response to a tweet from NERC was a response from Ibrahim Magaji Deba, who expressed disappointment in the services of the DisCos. He twitted: “DisCos that cannot maintain or install new transformers, failed to provide prepaid meters and outrageous estimated billing regime. Citizens are being ripped off on daily basis. Frankly, your situation room is of no good to consumers.” Another customer of Abuja DisCo, Hamman Usman complained of poor power supply as of Friday at Lugbe area of Abuja, twitting, “we hardly get light for three hours in a day, sometimes days of blackout since last year. Sincerely pathetic power supply and it was deliberate; with COVID-19 lockdown and blackout stress, how do you stay at home?” Mmeje Uchechukwu also complained about the situation in Gwagwalada in the FCT. “They are not helping matters. I have complained since Monday morning when the light went off; till now, there is no light.” In the FESTAC area of Lagos state, Ufon-Abasi Udofia said, “No power supply in some parts of FESTAC prior to and from onset of the movement cessation #COVID19Pandemic. We need electricity to enable effective stay at home.” Electricity: Illegal disconnections, fleecing, monsters for DisCos’ customers Consumers decry high  tariff despite blackouts Privatisation: 3 months after, electricity supply still erratic
