Siemens Nigeria has commenced the pilot phase of its Graduate Trainee Engineers and Management programme for fresh engineering and sciences graduates from Nigeria universities. According to a statement issued by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the capacity building initiative is aimed at tackling the depletion of professionals and skilled field service engineers in the country. Specifically, the company stated that the programme would focus on hiring, training and grooming local talents to meet the company’s business needs and its sustainability. Commenting on the on-boarding of the graduate trainees, Vice President, Services and Digital, Siemens Nigeria, Seun Suleiman,  said “We are excited to on-board these graduates to our field service department where they will be cross-trained across our product lines over the next 2 years. “Siemens is known as an employer of choice in the power and gas sector in Nigeria and this graduate trainee programme by our services distributed generation oil & gas business unit was driven by our commitment to provide a pool of young, talented and well trained service engineers in compliance with local content act of the Nigerian Government for human capital development.” “It is our goal that by the end of this programme we will graduate multi-skilled engineers who, in the future, will be able to take over from our experienced pool of senior engineers who currently demonstrate the capacity to support our fleet of over 360 gas turbines and compressors across our country. “This new breed of engineers will be globally certified across TCP, AGT, SGT & MGT product lines, making them experts in controls & mechanical discipline, which will be of great value to our customers and the industry in general,” Suleiman added. Following a series of screening, shortlisting and interviewing of candidates from top universities in Nigeria by an independent and reputable recruiter, five graduates where chosen and offered employment at Siemens. The programme which kicked off on March 2nd, 2020, will offer these graduate trainees’ two-years of world class training from Siemens in-country/on-site facility in Nigeria and Siemens’ Technical Competency Institute (TCI) at product lead centres in Europe and North America.
