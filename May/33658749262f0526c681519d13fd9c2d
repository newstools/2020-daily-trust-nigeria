Among those arrested were persons impersonating army officers. City News learnt that the violators who were arrested at Kubwa and Dutsen Alhaji suburbs of the FCT would be arraigned before the mobile court set up for COVID-19 restrictions violations. The Chairman of the task force, Ikharo Attah, who addressed journalists after the Wednesday night operation, said the team accosted the operator of a drinking bar at Second Gate, Dutsen Alhaji, who claimed to be a soldier, but that upon interrogation, he admitted that he lied in order to evade arrest. At Dutse Makaranta, the team shut down a bar which had customers a few minutes after 10:00pm.

Attah lamented that few persons did not understand the purpose of the curfew, saying among those arrested was a young woman who claimed she was going to visit a friend after 09:00pm. He added that two bricklayers were also caught while returning from Bauchi State and going to Bwari, despite the inter-state travel ban. He, therefore, appealed “to other enforcement officers across the country to close ranks and halt inter-state travelling which seems to be going on massively despite the presidential ban.” COVID-19: FCTA arrests 84 over travel ban violation COVID-19: 68 interstate travel ban violators arrested in Abuja COVID-19 lockdown: FCTA enforcement team arrests pastor, close 16 churches
