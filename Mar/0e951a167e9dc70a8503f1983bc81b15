The Brotherhood of the Cross and Star (BCS) has begun a week-long Evangelical Peace March of the Association of Brotherhood Academic Scholars International in Abuja. In a press briefing, the spokesman of the group, Christ Shepherd Edet Archibong, said the peace march is aimed at addressing the high level of insecurity in Nigeria, and to find solutions to them. The march with the theme ‘Leader Olumba Olumba Obu: the Giver of Peace’ while the slogan is ‘Peace, be still’, began on Monday and is expected to come to an end on Friday. “With the menace of insurgency, kidnappings, armed robbery, inter-tribal wars and a host of other security concerns, most Nigerians are yearning for peace which will come from the eradication of these societal challenges,” he said.  10,000 youths to march in Abuja as group holds Peace confab Olumba urges return to 12 states, old National Anthem Olumba bankrolls youth football fiesta in Cross River
