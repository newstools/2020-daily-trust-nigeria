A former governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, has been advised to eschew any action or utterance capable of further fuelling the crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. A stalwart of the party in the state, Alhaji Fatai Ibikunle, gave the advice while speaking with newsmen on the crisis rocking the party. Ibikunle, who is chairman of the National Lottery Regulatory Commission, said the promotion of hate, lies, character assassination and other destructive tendencies by those who had benefited massively through the party, was wrong, wicked and a deliberate attempt to deprive the young ones in the progressive fold of the opportunities of realising their political goals. He maintained that he had never at any time left APC, contrary to insinuations in a paid advertisement sponsored by some prominent politicians that served in the last administration. He described as “most wicked and evil” the allegation that he collected money from Senator Soji Akanbi to step down for him in the last election, stating that he had never and would never engage in such an act and challenged anybody with evidence to come out with it. “I am a progressive to the core and my primary interest is to see that our great party, the All Progressives Congress, regains all that we lost in the last general elections,” he said.
