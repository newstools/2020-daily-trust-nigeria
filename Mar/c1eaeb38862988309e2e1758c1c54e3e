President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called on the Armed Forces to intensify actions to bring the insurgency to put to a speedy conclusion,” Buhari made the call at State House, Abuja, at the inauguration of the National Humanitarian Coordination Committee chaired by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq. “I wish to commend our Armed Forces for their commitment towards eliminating the remnants of Boko Haram terrorists and securing the affected communities for the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected populations. I urge our Armed Forces to put more efforts to bring the insurgency to a speedy conclusion”. The president, who charged the armed forces to make clinical finishing of the remnants of Boko Haram insurgents, said the rehabilitation of devastated communities was set to begin in earnest. He said his government would ensure that permanent peace and stability returned to the troubled Northeast. Buhari said the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development was established last year to also harmonise all humanitarian activities in the region for greater effectiveness apart from its mandate to develop humanitarian policies and provide effective coordination of national and International humanitarian interventions, among others. “As a result of the mindless actions of the terrorists, many of our compatriots have been killed, maimed, or displaced from their communities. This necessitated the efforts of this administration to develop immediate interventions and measures to alleviate the sufferings of those affected, and to ensure their proper resettlement,” he said. Buhari, who hailed local and international partners for their assistance over time, assured them of continued government commitment.
