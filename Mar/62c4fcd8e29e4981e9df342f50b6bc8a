The Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Dr. Paul Enenche, has donated medical kits to Abuja residents through the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) to curtail the spread of coronavirus. Enenche, while donating the 20 cartons of hand sanitizers, packets of hand gloves and face masks, to the FCT minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijanni Aliyu, said  they were meant to make life meaningful for the common man. The senior pastor, accompanied by his wife, Dr Becky Enenche, said the donation was to complement the efforts of government in combating the pandemic, as according to him, the task was enormous and needed all hands on deck. “We as a church came to see the FCT Minister of State in the light of the current situation of the global pandemic of COVID-19. “We have seen the devastation it has caused around the world and the emergency efforts put in place by the government. “We want to be on the same page with government in line with the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ, who made life meaningful for the common man. “We are not just going to pray and trust in God to save us, but we must come out to support the constituted authorities,” he said. The minister while receiving the items, commended the Dunamis church for showing love and concern, saying Nigeria had overcome difficult situations in the past and would overcome again. “This is a trying period for all of us. However, in this trying moment, you have exhibited another leadership quality. “We don’t have to wait for the government to do all the things required for us to curtail this disease,” she said. Enenche said the church also donated medical equipment and materials to  the Primary Health Care Centre, Lugbe in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC).
