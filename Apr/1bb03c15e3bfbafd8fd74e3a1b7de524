One person has been killed and several houses burnt after renewed communal clashes in Ikpayongo community  of Gwer East Local Government Area in Benue State. Daily Trust gathered that the latest incident happened on Monday among the Mbasombo people of Ikpanyongo, a rural town some10-minutes’ drive from the state capital Makurdi. A similar incident took place on March, 11, this year between the Mbaivar and Mbasombo people of Ikpayongo barely few days after the both communities disagreed over the location where one of their dead ought to be buried. Witnesses said that the fresh crisis was still traceable to land matters, noting that for several months now, the Mbaivar referred to as settlers had been at logger head with the Mbasombo who are known as indigenes basically due to land dispute. Villagers told our correspondent in Makurdi that several houses were razed with fire in the Monday disturbances while one man was killed during the gun battle which ensued among the rival parties to the crisis. Contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene, confirmed the breakdown of law and order in the vicinity even as she admitted that one person was killed. Anene said 10 houses were burnt and that three people have been arrested in connection with the crisis while adding that security operatives have been deployed to restore calm in the troubled area.
