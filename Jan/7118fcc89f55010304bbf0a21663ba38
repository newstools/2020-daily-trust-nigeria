Suspected motorcycle snatchers allegedly stabbed a middle aged man, Mr Nwako Victory, while on hisÂ  way to the farm and escaped with his motorcycle at Manderegi village in Abaji Area Council. A witness, who identified himself simply as Zubairu, said the farmer was riding on his motorcycle to the farm when the suspected thieves, who were also riding on a motorcycle, intercepted him near Manderegi village. He said the two men had trailed the farmer and when he got to a secluded spot, they cornered him and stabbed him in the neck and abdomen. Zubairu said the victim managed to crawl to the main road from the bush path, where he fell unconscious and Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) officers later rescued and took him to the hospital. Our reporter learnt that the victim who is resident in Abaji Staff Quarters has been treated and discharged after two days at the Abaji general hospital.
