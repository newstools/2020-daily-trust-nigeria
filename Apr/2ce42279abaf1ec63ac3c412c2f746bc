President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the latest attacks by bandits in Katsina State will be met with “decisive force” in line with his commitment to security of the people. President Buhari, in a statement issued last night by his media aide, Garba Shehu, condemned the attacks by bandits in three local government areas that left 47 persons dead. The President, while reacting to the incident, said he would not tolerate such large scale killing of innocent people by the bandits. He directed the security agencies not to rest on their oars or lower their guard which will create a vacuum for the bandits to strike. Buhari, who said that he was “deeply saddened” by the latest development, called on Nigerians not to despair because his administration is ever determined to defeat and crush the criminal elements taking advantage of the lockdown to attack their victims. The President, who voiced his sympathies to the families of the victims, called on the people to show more vigilance by reporting the activities of criminal elements in their midst.
