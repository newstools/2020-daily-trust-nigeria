The Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding MOU with National Space Research & Development Agency (NASRDA) that will help to provide a framework to develope the Nigerian Postcode Ecosystem and Infrastructure. Daily Trust reports that a comprehensive postcode was developed by Nigerian Postal Service for Nigeria relying on its internal geographers, who depended largely on maps to arrive at the present Postcode. In his opening remarks, at the ceremony in NASRDA Head office, the Postmaster General of the Federation, Dr. Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, expressed his delight at the collaboration as NASRDA is the custodian of high resolution mapping in the country. Adewusi stated that a standard postcode will assist the country to enhance efficient socio- economic planning, security intelligence gathering, and provide investors information that will galvanise sustainable resource management.
