The Rector of the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria, Capt. Abdulsalami Mohammed, has said that the completion of  the re-fleeting programme which will lead to replacement of the institution’s old aircraft would save it at least N75m annually on fuelling alone. The rector told our correspondent exclusively that the new aircraft would improve the college’s training efficiency as well as substantially reduce its overhead cost. “Currently, Avgas comes to us at about N1000/litre. While Jet A-1 is about N250/litre, we spend about N100 million on Avgas annually. That means an annual saving of about N75m. “We hope to place the orders annually. Due to budgetary constraints, it may take 3-4 years to complete the orders’’, the NCAT CEO said. According to available data on the re-fleeting programme, the $20 million programme will enable NCAT to acquire 15 Diamond DA40NG (single engine) and 5 DA42NG (twin engine) aircraft. The Diamond aircraft meets with the College’s requirements for modern aircraft as they run on Jet A1 fuel and are equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS). Already the college has procured seven of the aircraft (one twin engine and six single engines).
