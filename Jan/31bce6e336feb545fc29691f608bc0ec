A 35 year-old man, Adams Ibrahim of Okene Kogi State, has been arraigned by the FCT police command for allegedly  receiving stolen vehicles. The prosecuting counsel, Saidu Jibrin, told the court that the defendant was arrested by a team of detectives from CID FCT police command, Abuja, led by DSP Oboli Azuka. He said the suspect had  in his possession,  cars he could not give satisfactory account of, adding that two Toyota Camry sedans, a BMW car and   a  Toyota Sienna were found with him. “The matter is a first information report and with the leave of the court, I apply that the FIR be read to him so he can take his plea. “Contrary to section 319 of the penal code law, the defendant is however guilty of the mentioned offense,” he said. The defendant who pleaded not guilty, however, begged for lenience. The prosecutor said “in view of the plea of the defendant, we shall be asking for a date to commence trial. The defendant’s counsel, AP Samson, prayed the court to admit the defendant to bail. The magistrate, Musa Jabbo, having heard from both parties said “the defendant is hereby admitted to bail in the sum of N500, 000 and two sureties, one of which must be a land owner or property within the jurisdiction of this court and must provide proof of ownership.”  Man arraigned over stolen cars I was at a wedding when robbery occurred, man tells court Police arraign businesswoman over trespass, threat to officer
