The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has said that contrary to previous practice where parties and contestants looked for voters to buy their votes, it is the voters in Edo State that are now looking for the highest bidder to sell their votes to. This is contained in the CDD Election Analysis Centre (EAC) Pre-Election briefing jointly presented on Thursday in Abuja by the CDD Director, Idayat Hassan; Chair CDD-EAC, Prof. Adele Jinadu; and Senior Fellow CDD, Prof. Jibrin Ibrahim. According to the report, the Edo election is another litmus test of Nigeria’s commitment to organising credible elections.
