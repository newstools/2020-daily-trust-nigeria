The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has advised its members to adhere to safety standards and protocols released by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19. The association’s stance is coming on the heels of a viral report on a manufacturing company that is allegedly holding workers against their will to operate in its factory during the lockdown following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. It stated that the report was contrary to its directives to members especially manufacturers of essential items who were permitted to operate during the lockdown. The president of the association, Engr. Mansur Ahmed, clarified: “They were advised to provide requisite facilities for the prevention of COVID-19 in line with extant guidelines of the NCDC. “MAN has instructively communicated to her members at the initial phase of easing of lockdown that their establishments should put in place control measures to flatten the curve or reduce the risk of further spreading of COVID-19 as well as what employers and businesses can do to protect the health and safety of staff. “The communication also spoke to adherence to guidelines in a case of staff member(s) within an organization suspected with symptoms of COVID-19”, the industrialist added.
