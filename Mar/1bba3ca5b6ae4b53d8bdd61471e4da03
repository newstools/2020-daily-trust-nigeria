The Court of Appeal in Abuja has upheld the election of Senator Ifeanyi Ubah against Obinna Uzoh as the senator for Anambra South Senatorial District. A five-member panel of justices led by Justice Stephen Adah declared the FCT High Court ruling which disqualified Ubah over alleged forgery of school certificate as a nullity, and set it aside. The panel held that the originating summons was incompetent having not been signed by counsel in the matter, adding that the judgment from it was also void. The panel held that the lower court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit earlier filed by Anani Anacletus Chuka and Obinna Uzoh, who contested in the election, and awarded N250,000 against both of them. It restrained INEC from giving effect to the judgment of the lower court or tampering with Ubah’s certificate of return.
