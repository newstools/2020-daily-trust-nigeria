Some youths in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have said the inclusion of Suleiman Sani, a native, on the list ambassadorial nominees showed that President Muhammadu Buhari cares about them. The youths, under the auspices of Abuja Original Inhabitants Youths Empowerment Organisation (AOIYEO), described the nomination as “one of Buhari’s best appointments”. The group’s president, Isaac David, said the nominee, a native of Abaji Area Council, had an impressive track record in Nigeria’s administrative sector, adding that he would assist the government in portraying the good image of Nigeria. He said the appointment showed that President Buhari had heard their cry over the exclusion of FCT indigenes in the first ambassadorial list. David further called on Suleiman Sani not to disappoint the people of Abuja, and to work in the interest of the President Buhari change agenda, the FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello and the entire natives of Abuja.
