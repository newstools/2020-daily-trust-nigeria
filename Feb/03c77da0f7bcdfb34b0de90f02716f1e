Edo State government has alleged that the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM) are planning to sponsor protests across the state targeted at maligning and undermining the government. A statement signed by the media aid to the governor, Crusoe Osagie, said the motive behind it is to “incite the public and cause disaffection in the state in order to slow down the rapid pace of development in the state.” He said having failed in his ambition to impose himself as the godfather in the state, Oshiomhole and his allies have resorted to a final option of stage-managing protests and violent attacks to cause crisis and disaffection among the people. He said, “They are exploring other options of public disobedience and disturbances aimed at disrupting public peace and undermining the safety of Edo people.” “We restate the government’s commitment to ensuring peace and security. We urge the people to go about their lawful businesses without apprehension,” he said. Responding, a chieftain of the APC loyal to Oshiomhole’s faction, Samson Osagie, said Obaseki’s government was reputed for sponsoring thugs and arsonists against political opponents in APC. “Why will Adams Oshiomhole mastermind such protest? Is he contesting for governorship position? “We are all card-carrying members of the APC and his write up should be ignored because he is suffering from frustration arising from the inability to seek endorsement from Adams Oshiomhole,” he said.
