 The Nigerian Air Force yesterday said its fighter jets destroyed an Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) staging area at Gashigar and as well taking out terrorists’ hideouts at Tumbun Rego on the fringes of Lake Chad and at Bula Bello near the Sambisa Forest, all in Borno State. In a statement, NAF spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said this was achieved in airstrikes conducted by the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole on 24 and 25 January 2020 on the heels of credible intelligence reports. He said the attack on Gashigar was executed on 25 January 2020 after Intelligence; surveillance and reconnaissance missions indicated that the location, with its defensive parapets and underground tunnels was being used by the ISWAP elements as a staging area where some of their leaders and fighters meet to plan and launch attacks. He said the ATF detailed its fighter aircraft to attack the identified location, destroying the structures, killing several terrorists in the process. Daramola also said fighter jets were dispatched to attack Tumbun Rego and Bula Bello on 24 January 2020 after ISR aircraft detected significant activities in the two settlements. He said the aircraft effectively engaged the targeted locations equally destroying terrorist assets and neutralizing several of their combatants. He said in all, scores of terrorists were neutralized in the three attacks, including some of their key leaders as later confirmed by Human Intelligence reports.
