The Federal Government has granted licences to Media Trust Limited, the publishers of Trust titles; the Nigeria Police, and the Nigeria Customs Service to operate radio stations in the country. With the licence, the Media Trust, which started a sterling newspaper business in 1998, is now set to begin radio broadcasting from its head office in Abuja. Apart from the Media Trust, the Police and Customs, 62 other companies and government agencies, including the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, two newspapers and eight tertiary institutions   were also granted radio and television licences. The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) in a statement yesterday said the licences  were granted consequent upon the approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The NBC advised the successful companies and government institutions to collect their letters of grant of provisional operating licences from the commission, starting from today.
