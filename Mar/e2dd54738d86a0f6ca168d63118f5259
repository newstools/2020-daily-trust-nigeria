The director of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Dr. Ahmed Danfulani, has said it will soon commence a community based health insurance scheme across the six area councils. Danfulani, made this known when he led some staff of the scheme on a courtesy visit to the Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, in his office yesterday. He said the scheme would commence in Gwagwalada and would cost an enrollee a token of N500 a month for a comprehensive health insurance package for the selected people that the council would choose. He said the NHIS had paid an advocacy visit to traditional rulers and community leaders across the area council, saying the propragmme will be like a precondition for the attainment of basic healthcare. “And to formalise this sir, we are going to request a date where we will come around to officially flag -off the programme,” he said. Responding, the council chairman, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, commended the NHIS for extending the health insurance scheme to rural communities. He said assured that the council would support the scheme to succeed. “It is our primary responsibility to take primary healthcare seriously. So if you have a complementary effort just like the one you have initiated, we are fully in support and we shall give every necessary assistance to the scheme,” he said.
