Officials of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe State have petitioned the Police Command over an alleged attack on them by supporters of a former governor of the state. The Assistant Publicity Secretary of the state APC, Sabo Ibrahim Kashere and Deputy Chairman of the party in Akko LGA, Garba Sarkin Fada, had in a petition to the state Commissioner of Police, sought for protection against supporters of the former governor who they accused of attacking them. In the petition, the complainants all residents of Kashere town in Akko LGA, alleged that on March 29, one Mohammed Isa Tolba, Umaru Yakubu, Dahiru Ibrahim Chairman, Hamza Wakili, Gamma Bala, Sallau Hashimu, Alhassan West, Abdulwahab Uba and Kawule Bobobo conspired among themselves and attacked Sabo Kashere. The letter, which was also copied to the Inspector General of Police, AIG Zone 3 Yola, DG SSS and the state Director of SSS, alleged sinister efforts and plans by the gang to wreak havoc not only against the petitioners but constitute a security threat to the people and residents of Kashere town and environs. However, a legislative aide to Senator Danjuma Goje, Barrister Mu’azu Kumo, debunked the claims. According to him, it was all a mischief launched against the senator to destroy his name and the reputation he built over the years. “We discovered that the said attack had never taken place, talk less of being sponsored by Senator Danjuma Goje. It was mischief sponsored by his political opponent to destroy his good name,” Barrister Kumo added. Contacted, the command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Obed Mary Malum, confirmed that the police had received a letter from the complainants. She said investigation was ongoing over the matter, adding that the police would take appropriate action after its investigation.
