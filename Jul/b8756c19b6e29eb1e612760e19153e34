He said, “Using a Centralized Offtake and Supply System supported by a Decentralized Aggregation and Production network, PAGMI’ will buy all the gold produced by artisanal and Small-scale miners and aggregated by licensed buying centres and aggregators for supply to the Central Bank of Nigeria.” The minister further stated that currently Nigeria has two gold refineries in ogun state and Abuja with the one in Ogun near completion. He further stated that there are 400 buying centers across the country which have been registered biometrically were gold are sourced and sold responsibly.
