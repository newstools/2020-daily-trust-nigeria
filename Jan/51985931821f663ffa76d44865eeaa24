The Yobe State Youth stakeholders for APC have rejected the purported zoning of the National Secretary position to Borno and Yobe states The forum’s chairman, Mohammed Shehu Gadaka described the decision as ‘’absolute injustice capable of bringing disunity in the party.” He said Yobe State should produce the National Secretary as replacement of Mai Mala Buni to complete the remaining three years tenure of the elected position. “As we are all aware, the position of the national secretary became vacant after Hon. Mai Mala Buni ascended the governorship seat in Yobe state in the last general elections,” he said. He added that the National leadership of the party under Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has repeatedly insisted that the position of the party’s scribe should remain in Yobe.
