The North East Peace Advocates have showered praises on President Muhammadu Buhari and Engr Mustapha Y. Maihaja for restoring transparency and accountability to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). The group made this known in a strategic report to appraise emergency management after a thorough study of NEMA’s activities in the North-East with regards to crisis management. In the report signed by President, Comrade Bitrus Ali on Sunday, the group hailed the Director-General for inch-perfect interventions in mitigating the suffering of internally displaced persons in the North-East. “Our researchers were able to identify the emphasis on accountability in the discharge of their duties, and this much has seen to the rise of the effective management of the crisis in the region. “The various initiatives employed by NEMA have a tremendous impact on the lives of those that have been affected by the crisis in the area,” the group noted. The North East Peace Advocates observed NEMA’s strong presence in villages, communities, and hamlets, all thanks to Maihaja’s reforms structured in line with best global practices in disaster and emergency management. According to the group, this wouldn’t have been possible without President Buhari’s willpower who has displayed an extraordinary commitment to addressing disasters and emergencies in Nigeria through the appointment of Maihaja. The North East Peace Advocates, however, advised ministries, departments, and agencies in the country to emulate the accountability and transparency in NEMA’s operations. While urging President Buhari to honour Maihaja, the group admonished the NEMA DG not to rest on his laurels.
