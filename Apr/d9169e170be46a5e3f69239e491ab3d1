The General Overseer of the Resurrection Praise Ministries for Africa, Archbishop Samson Benjamin, yesterday urged street urchins, widely known as Area Boys, not to attack their neighbours in the name of hunger, saying that the difficult times would soon be over. Benjamin, who also advised the federal government to use the €50 million donation by the European Union (EU) as a palliative for the masses, admitted there was suffering in the land “beyond what anyone can comprehend.” The cleric made this statement at the Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Area when his ministry visited and distributed food items worth thousands of naira to the needy in the community. Over 200 people benefited from the items, which included rice, beans, garri and condiments, as well as Vitamin C to help boost the immune system of the people. He said this was to complement the efforts of the federal government in reaching out to the masses and distributing relief materials during the lockdown period.
