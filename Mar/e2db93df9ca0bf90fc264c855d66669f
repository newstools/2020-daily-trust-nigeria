The management of Keystone Bank at the weekend announced the donation of N1 billion for the purchase of relief materials, critical care facilities and protective gear to contain the spread of coronavirus nationwide. The lender’s management made the pledge during the Bankers’ Committee meeting held to support the Central Bank of Nigeria in its bid to raise funds to fight the pandemic through the newly-formed Nigerian Private Sector Coalition Committee against COVID-19. The bank’s Acting Managing Director, Mr. Olaniran Olayinka, in a statement, explained that the decision to make the pledge was part of the bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility pillar to provide an enabling environment by improving the health of the communities wherein we operate. He explained: “What we have is a situation that calls for an inclusive support for humanity. A time that all hands must be on deck to support the assiduous effort the government is making to manage the situation. “The decision to support the government’s effort is consistent with our unshakable resolve to promote health initiatives which is a very key pillar in our corporate social responsibility plans. It is also crucial in our role as a signatory to the principles of responsible banking by the United Nations Environment Finance Initiative working to achieve a sustainable future. “At Keystone Bank, we remain firmly committed to our promise of supporting Nigerians to thrive, and this means for us showing up when it matters most. For us, this is one of such moments”, the banker added He expressed optimism that the current pandemic will soon be a thing of the past.
