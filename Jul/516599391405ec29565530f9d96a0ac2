Minority Leader Eyinnaya Abaribe described Osinowo as a soft-spoken, complete grassroots politician, who will be missed by his colleagues and constituents. Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, hailed Osinowo as a grassroots politician who left his mark on the sands of time. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the late Osinowo left a very deep impression that he was a friendly, jovial and unassuming person, even though he accomplished so much.
