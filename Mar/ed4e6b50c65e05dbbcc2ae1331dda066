Kwara State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) says it rejects Yekini Nabena’s declaration on the position of the party’s national publicity secretary, insisting that it is legitimately occupied by Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu. The National Vice Chairman (North West) of the party, Inuwa Abdulkadir, had on March 13, 2020, obtained an order of a Sokoto High Court restraining the party from appointing or electing “Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu or any member” into its top positions except through a national convention. The state chairman of the party, Alhaji Bashir Omolaja Bolarinwa, said the party in Kwara State received with dismay a statement credited to the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC, Mr Yekini Nabena, stating his intention to “take over” the office of the party’s National Publicity Secretary currently and legitimately occupied by Issa-Onilu. He said the position had been zoned to the North Central zone and micro zoned to Kwara State. The statement said in Nabena’s attempt to announce his “takeover”, he failed to avail himself of the legal requirements for APC national offices. “It is necessary and important we allow ourselves to be guided by the rules and hopefully desist from going down the rabbit hole,” it said. The party said following the APC zoning arrangement which has been respected and strictly adhered to, national offices are filled through the convention or replacement from the zone which applied to Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu and other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) whenever there’s a vacancy. The party called on the NWC of APC to allow Issa-Onilu to remain the occupant of the office.
