The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) has announced that it recorded a growth of 14.3 per cent growth in its net income in 2019 financial year, rising from $275.9 million recorded in 2018 financial year to $313.3 million in 2019. A statement released yesterday by the bank showed that its audited financial statements for the 2019 financial year indicated growth, with total comprehensive income standing at $324.2 million, while the operating income rose to $622.5 million in 2019 compared to $489.8 million in 2018. Also, the bank’s total assets grew by 7.6 per cent from $13.42 billion on 31 December 2018 to $14.44 billion as at 31 December 2019, explained mainly by the solid growth in net loans and advances.

The Bank’s President, Prof. Benedict Oramah, expressed satisfaction with the results, noting that the performance exceeded strategic plan targets despite a global operating environment characterised by economic uncertainties. He said that the Bank had “continued to deliver the objectives of its current five-year strategic plan, dubbed IMPACT 2021, by prioritising initiatives aimed at promoting and financing intra-African trade.” On the outbreak of the  COVID-19 pandemic early this year and the growing concerns about its implications for the global economy, Oramah said the bank was taking necessary steps to manage the impact, particularly on the loans and advances from customers that may be impacted, assuring that, “Afreximbank is making arrangements to support its member-countries in need.” Afreximbank declares $285.4m income for 2018 Afreximbank declares $240.71m revenue in Q1 Wema Bank posts N590m profit in Q1
