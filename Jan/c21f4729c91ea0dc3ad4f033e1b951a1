Investors in the country’s agricultural sector have come together to form the Agricultural Bureau Association of Nigeria to enhance the nation’s agro-economic growth. The group, during the official launch ceremony weekend in Abuja, expressed concern over the existing gap in the agricultural sector in the country, adding that they will work hand-in-hand with all stakeholders involved in finding a lasting solution and providing employment opportunities in the country. Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the group, Sulaiman Dikwa, the CEO, Green Sahara Farms Limited, who was appointed as interim chairman, mobilisation committee of the group, said they would look at policies that would enhance businesses. “We want to engage government and relevant stakeholders so as to create sustainable agribusiness in Nigeria,” he said. Alhaji Sulaiman added that they would set up a structure that would ensure food quality within the agro system so that Nigerian goods are accepted both home and abroad. Also speaking, the Founder, Women Farmers Advance Network (WOFAN), Mrs Salamatu Garba, highlighted the gaps in the sector to include standardisation, poor quality control on most products as the major challenge militating against the acceptance of local products at the local and international markets.
