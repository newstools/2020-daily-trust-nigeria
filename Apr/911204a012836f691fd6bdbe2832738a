The Ogun State Police Command yesterday asked donors of stimulus packages in the state to liaise with Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) in their areas to provide security cover in the distribution of the packages. This, according to the Command, had become necessary following the alleged hijacking of relief materials by hoodlums in some parts of the state. A statement issued yesterday by the Command’s spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had directed all DPOs to always provide adequate security at the venues of such distribution. The statement reads, “in view of the lockdown order given by the Federal Government of Nigeria to checkmate the spread of the deadly coronavirus also known as COVID 19, it has been observed that various organizations, including religious bodies, non-governmental bodies and corporate organizations, as well as public spirited individuals have been providing food items to the vulnerable members of the public in order to ameliorate their sufferings while the lockdown lasts. “The Ogun State Police Command, in order to prevent the good gestures of these philanthropic people from being hijacked by hoodlums, hereby wishes to appeal to those with such good intentions to liaise with the DPOs of their respective areas whenever they want to go about distributing such materials so as to afford the police the opportunity of providing security cover for them during the process of distribution. “This becomes imperative in order to prevent the distribution of such palliative materials from degenerating to a free-for-all and a breakdown of law and order. It will also prevent hoodlums from hijacking the process, which may defeat the primary aim of the donors.” Coronavirus: Despite lockdown, social distancing fails in Lagos Lockdown: IG deploys Special Forces to Lagos over rising crime Police arrest 3 over theft of 4-year-old boy
