The Coalition of APC Support Groups has asked the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to immediately announce Arc. Waziri Bulama as the substantive National Secretary of the party. Chairman of the coalition Ambassador Lawan Muhammad Munir who spoke at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja, said his endorsement by the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) was in the best interest of the party, adding that no governor could superimpose the decision. Ambassador Munir said the delay might give room to unnecessary comments that would further divide the APC as Bulamaâ€™s track record stood him in good stead to take over the position.
