A political leader of Fulani youth in Nasarawa State, Jibrin Shuaibu, has said that no single Fulani person has been offered appointment in Nasarawa State under the present administration. He made the disclosure when he led a delegation from the state chapter of the Fulani Youth Forum of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who were on a courtesy call to Governor Abdullahi Sule at the government house, Lafia. Jibrin Shuaibu said, “As indigenous people, we have always contributed our quota to the flourishing of democracy in the state. I want to point out that no single Fulani has been offered political appointment.” Responding, Governor Abdullahi Sule thanked members of the forum for their role leading to the victory of the APC during the 2019 governorship election. He assured them that members of the group would be considered for political appointments, stressing that as an all-inclusive government, his administration will carry everybody along. As Gov.
