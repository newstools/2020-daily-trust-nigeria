The National Association for Promoting Democracy and Good Governance, Northern Nigeria Youth Front and Northwest Women for Better Nigeria are wooing the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, to vie for the 2023 presidency on the platform of the ruling APC. The groups, through their spokesman, Alhaji Shuaibu Mustapha Kano, described the minister as the best man who has the capacity to salvage the country’s ailing economy from the woods. Kano, who is a one-time Special Adviser on Political Matters to a former governor of Kano State, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, stressed the need for an Igbo presidency in the next presidential election so as “to give them a sense of belonging in the Nigerian project.” He urged Dr Onu to answer the clarion call to serve Nigeria and Nigerians for a better and prosperous country.
