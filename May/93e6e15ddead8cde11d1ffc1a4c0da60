The two factions of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State are again at daggers drawn over this weekend’s local government council elections. Whereas the faction led by Sir John Ochala, alleged to be the authentic and recognised, withdrew from the elections, citing irregularities, the other faction led by Mr. Godwin Etim John has fielded candidates and accused the other of being impostors. Mr. John, in press statement, noted that while it would serve no useful purpose to join issues with the alleged impostors, his own state working committee had the mandate to lead the party and to participate in the elections. He said, “We wish to clarify that APC has not decided to boycott the weekend local government elections. We have our candidates ready.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
