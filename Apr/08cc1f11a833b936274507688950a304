The United States Agency for International Development Mission to Nigeria (USAID/Nigeria) has called for applications for a Cooperative Agreement from qualified entities to implement the “Strengthening Civic Advocacy and Local Engagement” (SCALE) programme across the country. The Mission intends to award a Cooperative Agreement to implement the SCALE Activity to strengthen the financial, managerial, technical and advocacy capacity of local civil society organisations (CSOs) and business membership organizations (BMOs) in Nigeria. This activity will be carried out over. To fund the programme, the agency intends to provide a total sum of between $30 million to $33 million over a five-year period. According to a brief on the proposed activity which will be carried out over a five-year period from the effective date of award, the objective is to support CSOs and BMOs across all of USAID/Nigeria’s programmatic sectors with a basket of managerial, business strengthening, and advocacy capacity-building interventions aimed at advancing Nigerian CSO sustainability combined with targeted grants to advance mutually agreed upon priorities. The SCALE Activity is designed to enhance local civil society organizations’ ability to be positive and responsible change agents in the country. ‘USAID spends $400m annually on development interventions in Nigeria’ US ends 5-year project to transform governance US offers $65.5m to boost agreement with Nigeria
