Commercial sex workers in the country have decried the lockdown of some states, especially Lagos and Abuja, saying it has forced them to suspend their services as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The National Coordinator, Nigeria Sex Workers Association, Amaka Enemo, stated this on Tuesday, noting that although sex workers offer “essential services,” they will remain indoors because their services involve “substantial bodily contact”. She added that the association has enlightened its members on the dangers of COVID-19. “There is sensitisation across the country including within our network. Sex workers also offer essential services. However, there is no way sex workers can do their work without body contact. So, they are staying at home to watch what happens. “The government has announced a lockdown and as law-abiding citizens, we will not flout the law. If the government says sit at home, we will all obey because nobody wants to die. “We fall under essential services but ours is peculiar because of the nature of body contact. You cannot compare it to doctors because the doctors are not making full body contact with people the way we do. “The lockdown affects street workers and those at home equally. For the sake of their health, they should all stay at home and avoid bodily contact. So, we stay at home but we are sharing materials that will keep them safe,” she said. She further stated that the lockdown “is going to affect them financially but sex workers are not the only ones that make money on a daily basis. It is the same for commercial drivers. Of course, they might have their savings but that does not mean it will not affect them. It is affecting everybody so sex workers are not exempted.” COVID-19: Kaduna orders total lockdown COVID-19: How lockdown benefits the country – Medical experts COVID19: Why jobs and wages must be protected - NLC
