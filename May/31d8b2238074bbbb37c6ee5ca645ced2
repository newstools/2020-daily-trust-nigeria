An officer of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), identified as Assistant Superintendent Chidi Johnson, last Friday sustained severe injuries in an ambush laid by suspected smugglers in Ikpokia Local Government Area of Ogun State. Johnson was among a team of Customs men from Ogun 1 Command, said to have been sent to evacuate about 35 50kg bags of rice that smugglers brought into the country. It was learnt that the Customs men had embarked on the operation at about 7.30pm on Friday based on an intelligence report that suspected smugglers were stockpiling smuggled rice in a house at Ilashe village in Ipokia Local Government Area. The Public Relations Officer of the Ogun 1 Command of the NCS, Abdullahi Maiwada, who confirmed the attack, said the smugglers mobilised themselves in large numbers and launched “a vicious attack, with assorted  weapons, on the officers performing their lawful duties.” Dear valued readers, subscribe to the Daily Trust e-paper to continue enjoying our diet of authoritative news.
