Ogun State House of Assembly yesterday received the bill for the establishment of the state security network agency otherwise known as Amotekun Corps Bill. The speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, disclosed this yesterday while reading a letter sent to the parliament by Governor Dapo Abiodun. “I forward herewith a bill for a law to establish the Ogun State Security Network Agency and Amotekun Corps to assist in maintaining law and order in the state and for connected purposes as approved at the second meeting of the Executive Council of Ogun State held on 11th February 2020, for the kind consideration and passage of the House of Assembly,” the letter partly read. Meanwhile, the assembly has passed the State Judiciary Funds Management Law, 2020. The passage of the bill titled: “HB. No. 034/OG/2020- The Ogun State Judiciary Funds Management Law, 2020”, was consequent upon the presentation of the report of the House Committee on Justice, Ethics and Public Petitions led by Hon. Solomon Osho, who thereafter moved the motion for its adoption, seconded by Honourable Akeem Balogun and unanimously supported by the whole house through a voice vote. The speaker has, however, directed that the clean copy of the bill be forwarded to Governor Dapo Abiodun for his assent.
