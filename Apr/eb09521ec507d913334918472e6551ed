Twenty five civil servants in Ondo State have been suspended for alleged fraud. One of them was said to have put his wife who is not a civil servant on grade level 14 and has been collecting salary. Senior Special Assistant to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Special Duties, Doyin Adebowale, disclosed this when he paraded the 25 civil servants yesterday in Akure, the Ondo State capital. The workers were said to have been caught for various offences including stealing millions of naira, employment racketeering and using fictitious names in the pay roll of the state government to syphon money. One of those suspended, a staff of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) was said to have stolen a total sum of N104m from the coffers of SUBEB. Odebowale told newsmen that the suspended civil servants would be prosecuted. He said the affected staff members were caught due to reforms carried out by the Head of Service, Mr. Alex Aragbaye. He said: “In the civil service, there has been this stealing going on undetected. They do it in several ways, especially through staff list. “We have people that imputed fictitious figures into the payroll. When the new Head of Service got into office, he put in place certain reforms to make us know those in actual service. “We were able to discover that certain elements whose names appear on staff list were never employed. “One of them moved 104 million out of SUBEB account. We have other instances of other millions of naira moved. These were pure stealing. They have been suspended. They will be prosecuted and made to face disciplinary measures.” Ondo to prosecute 25 civil servants for fraud Five Ondo civil servants arrested, paraded for alleged N200m tax fraud 5 Ondo civil servants arrested, paraded for alleged N200m tax fraud
