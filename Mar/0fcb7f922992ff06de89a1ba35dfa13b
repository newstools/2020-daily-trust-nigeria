 The Lagos State Vehicle Inspection Service (VIS) has commenced issuance and distribution of roadworthiness compliance letters to corporate organisations, associations, unions, institutions and other professional bodies. The letter, titled, ‘Statutory Inspection of Vehicles for Road Worthiness’, explained that this would enable organisations present vehicles in their fleet for computerised vehicle inspection. The Director of the VIS, Engineer Akin George Fashola, said the development was in line with the vision of Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu to revolutionize traffic management and transportation in the state. This was contained in a statement by the Service’s Head, Research, Planning and Development, Engineer Olumide Olayemi, who quoted the VIS Director as saying the measure became necessary to ensure vehicles plying Lagos Stat e roads meet the minimum standards of safety “as vehicles are expected to drive with a valid and updated Road Worthiness Certificate and a MOT Test Certificate.” Fashola said, “Fleet vehicles fall under the spectrum of commercial vehicles whose risks must be mitigated to ensure they are safe at all times for use by staff. This is why it is necessary to ensure that the vehicles must be inspected to determine its roadworthiness status. “Recipients of the demand for compliance letters have been issued roadworthiness certificates but are yet to present the vehicles at its Lagos Computerised Vehicle Inspection Service (LACVIS) test centres. Hence, administrators of fleets of vehicles have an obligation to carry out the statutory inspection and to be informed if there is any defect detected, which will form part of their fleet policy maintenance routines.” The Director explained that the inspection of fleet covered heavy goods vehicles, tankers and trailers that are duly registered in Lagos State and plying Lagos State roads.
