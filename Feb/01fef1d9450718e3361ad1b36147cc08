A High Court sitting in Lokoja has declared the impeachment of a former deputy governor of Kogi State, Elder Simon Achuba, by the state Assembly as null and void. Achuba was impeached as deputy governor in October 2019 over allegations of gross misconduct levied against him. Justice John Olorunfemi of Lokoja High Court 4 in his judgement yesterday declared that the removal of the former deputy governor from office by the Assembly was a violation of the constitution. He held that the subsequent nomination of Chief Edward Onoja as deputy governor, following the said impeachment did not follow due process. The judge added that the actions and subsequent nomination of another person to the office by the lawmakers was null and void. Justice Olorunfemi described the action of the Kogi State House of Assembly as a “constitutional coup, hatched and executed in a democracy”. He pointed out that the action of the state lawmakers was contrary to Section 188 (8) which barred the Assembly from further action having discovered that the former deputy governor was not found wanting by a panel that investigated him over allegations of gross misconduct. Elder Achuba had dragged the Kogi State House of Assembly and 29 others to court following his removal as the deputy governor of Kogi State on October 18, 2020.
