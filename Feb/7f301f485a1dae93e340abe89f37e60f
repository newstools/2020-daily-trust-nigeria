The Society of Nigerian Artists, Abuja chapter, has donated art materials to Government Secondary School, Bwari, with a promise it will do same for similar schools in the other councils of the FCT. Chairman of the Society, Abuja chapter, Chike Emebo, who led his members to the school, said the donation is part of The Future Artists Project, which  is an art education intervention programme initiated to help in  building a robust and thriving art sector. Emebo said the programme would also provide interest and meaningful engagement to the youths in school. He also said the society would provide periodic technical assistance, guidance and counselling as it concerns art as a career and support the students with art supplies. “Schools in the FCT are experiencing lack of qualified teachers and poor curriculum content, and as a result, we find the arts subsumed into music and dance. A few of these schools have proper art studios or an environment that aids creativity. The students are the ones that suffer as they don’t have all their potential maximised at this level of their academic pursuit. Nigeria also suffers as skills that ought to be encouraged and fanned into flames are actually snuffed out, leaving us with unemployment, youth restiveness and a struggling economy,” Emebo said. The Vice Principal of the school, Mr Sylvester Iziiyon, said the donation has changed his view about artists and promised to encourage students to pursue arts as a career.
