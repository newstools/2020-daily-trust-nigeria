Eighteen political parties yesterday backed de-registration of 74 parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), saying the development will sanitise the electoral process in the country. The parties also constituted an interim management committee for the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), chaired by the National Chairman of African Action Congress (AAC), Dr Leonard Nzenwa, to steer the affairs of the council pending the election of a new executive. A communiqué signed by leaders of the 18 parties after an emergency meeting held yesterday in Abuja, said the interim committee would commence work immediately with INEC and other stakeholders and the National Assembly with a view to ensuring that the electoral reform processes were elaborate and conclusive. The 18 parties include Accord Party (AP), Action Alliance (AA), African Action Congress (AAC), African Democratic Congress (ADC), African Democratic Party (ADP), All Progressives Congress (APC), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), and Allied Peoples Movement (APM). Others are Labour Party (LP), New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), National Rescue Movement (NRM), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peoples Redemption Party   (PRP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), Young Progressive Party (YPP), Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Action Peoples Party (APP) and Boot Party (BT).
