A member of the national caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf (APC, Taraba Central), has said that the panel was working hard to ensure the victory of the party in the forthcoming elections in Edo and Ondo states. Yusuf stated this while fielding questions from journalists in Abuja weekend on efforts made so far by the Governor Mai Mala Bunu-led National Caretaker Committee. Senator Yusuf, who represents the Senate in the caretaker committee, said it was working with all stakeholders of the party in Edo and Ondo states for the required unity before the governorship elections. He said, “The caretaker committee has been working towards making reconciliation with all our members and also working assiduously to see that we retain Edo and Ondo states in the upcoming elections. “You know in politics 24 hours is a very long time. “Anything can happen. “You know, we are in the process of reconciliation. “The governor of Niger State is working on the reconciliation in Ondo State.” Senator Yusuf said though the committee was making progress in achieving the desired unity among the various groups in the party, it was facing some challenges.
