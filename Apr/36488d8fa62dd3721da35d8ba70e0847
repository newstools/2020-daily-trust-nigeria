As the novel coronavirus pandemic ravages, private firms have expressed fear that they might not be able to sustain staff salary from April due to the lockdown. The Federal Government had since March 31, 2020 placed Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states on lockdown as a measure to contain the spread of the deadly virus. The principal partner of Taiwo O.S Fadahunsi & Co Legal Practitioner, Mr. Taiwo Fadahunsi in an interview stressed the need for government through the States’ Inland Revenue Services to assist private firms financially to enable them meet up their obligation of paying staff salary. He explained: “As employers of labour and as private firms, we pay some amount of money to the Lagos State Inland Revenue Service for instance on a monthly basis. From the record of payment, the revenue service can find out firms that do not default and then assist them with funds to enable them pay staff salary, else there is nothing we can do,” “Unlike civil servants, who would get their salary by government, private firms only make money when they work. So as the lockdown continues and we are not working, government needs to come to our aid by assisting us to pay our staff so that they don’t go hunger strike. Leaving us alone without assistance will make things difficult for both we the employers and employees,” Taiwo added.
