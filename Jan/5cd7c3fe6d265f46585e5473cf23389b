Family of the governorship candidate of the APC, Alhaji Mukhtar Shehu Idris yesterday asked the Zamfara State Commissioner of Finance to apologise over the list of ghost workers he published. The finance  commissioner,  Alhaji Rabiu Garba Gusau, had last week disclosed that about 5,000 ghost workers had been uncovered in the state. Names of some of the ghost workers were listed. Reacting, the family of Idris, who is popularly known as Koguna, faulted the claims of the commissioner that one of their family members was among the ghost workers. The family, in a statement by Imran Ahmad Rufai, demanded an unreserved apology from the commissioner  “for misleading the general public about Nusaiba Shehu Idris (a name that does not exist in the entire family) for being part of the state Salary Scandal. Similarly, a group known as Concerned Citizens of Zamfara State has challenged Gusau to publish the names of the 4,972 persons allegedly authorised by the former Governor Abdulazeez Yari to be collecting salaries. A statement issued in Sokoto state and signed by their Secretary, Musa Ibrahim Gusau also challenged the commissioner to publish names of the 1640 staff whose account numbers were not on the server and the 119 staff whose names on the payroll differed from the account numbers if he was serious about his claim. They further challenged him to showcase the alleged irregularities that persisted under the supervision of the former Commissioner of Finance, Alhaji Mukhtar Shehu Idris.
