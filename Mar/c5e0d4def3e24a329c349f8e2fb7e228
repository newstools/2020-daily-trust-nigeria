Detectives from the Alagbado police station, Lagos State Police Command, have arrested a fake soldier, Yusuf Bello, for allegedly violating the state government’s traffic laws on restriction of the operation of commercial motorcycle, widely known as okada’, in some areas of the metropolis. Bello’s arrest on Saturday at Alagbado, Agege motorway, came barely a week after two men were nabbed at Oshodi for allegedly impersonating a soldier and a police officer to commit the same traffic offence. The police said Bello was dressed in full Nigerian Army uniform when he was arrested. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the arrest, said that on March 6, 2020 at about 8.30pm, the police intercepted Bello, 38, a native of Gwoza, Borno State, dressed in military uniform and carrying passengers on an unregistered Bajaj motorcycle. Elkana said the suspect was arrested and the motorcycle impounded, adding that military camouflage and naval uniforms were recovered from him. “The suspect was also in possession of a fake military identity card. Investigation is on-going to ascertain the source of the military uniforms and the link the suspect has with other criminal activities like traffic robbery, etc.”, he said.
